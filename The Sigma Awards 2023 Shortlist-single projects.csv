Netherlands,"El Pais, Lighthouse Reports, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, Enass, The Independent",Big,Winner (joint),"The Prize Committee jointly recognized two entries on the same topic, and with overlapping partners, for their groundbreaking investigation into the inhumane treatment of asylum seekers and migrants attempting to enter Europe.

The teams comprised Lighthouse Reports and its partners, El Pa√≠s, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, SRF Rundschau, and Republik. 

In the first entry, the team used advanced visual investigation techniques to reveal the tragic events that led to the deaths of 23 people and the disappearance of 77 others at the border post in Melilla, Spain. The investigation‚Äôs impact was significant, resulting in extensive questioning of the interior minister in Parliament and follow-up reporting that confirmed the deaths on the Spanish side. This story sheds light on the challenges that asylum seekers and migrants face when seeking protection in Europe.

In the second, the team obtained the internal Joint Operations Reporting Application (JORA) database via a Freedom of Information Request and conducted a data-driven investigation that confirmed Frontex‚Äôs involvement in 22 pushbacks concerning 957 people. This investigation was remarkable in its combination of data mining, cross-referencing, and visual evidence to expose the secret agency‚Äôs illegal activities. The investigation led to the resignation of Fabrice Leggeri, Executive Director of Frontex, the day after the publication, as the evidence presented was damning.

These projects are a testament to the importance of collaborative, data-driven investigative journalism in exposing abuses of power and holding those in authority accountable.

Despite the appalling death toll,
serious questions remain unanswered by Spain and Morocco over what happened. Lighthouse Reports and partners El Pa√≠s, Le Monde and Der Spiegel undertook the most advanced visual investigation to date to establish what happened at the border post and how an attempt to seek protection in
Europe led so many people to a violent death.","Our report, published initially in El Pais in Spain, was which featured made headlines in the entire country, the interior minister was extensively
questioned in Parliament and accused by all but two parties of having lied. Spanish MPs used photos and evidence from our film to question the minister.
Our film was showed by an MEP at a European parliament debate on the issue and there was extensive follow up reporting on the death we were able to prove happened on the Spanish side.","The shock, confusion and sheer number of people involved in the Melilla deaths left behind a fragmented trail of
digital clues. Graphic but often meaningless in isolation, once located in time and space these clues can begin to
be pieced together forensically to make sense of an event and compare conflicting accounts of what has
happened. Our team sourced and analysed 145 video clips, mainly shaky phone camera footage, scouring all
available online platforms related to the events of June 24. By spending time on the ground we were able to trace
40 survivors (many of whom are visible in the videos of the day) and obtain previously unseen visual evidence. We
then geolocated, and synchronised this material, placing it on a timeline. Our reporters gained access to the
border post at the centre of the deaths and took footage of its interior and layout. Using this material as a
reference alongside LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data, we built a detailed animated model of the border
crossing and the surrounding area. We used this model to understand the layout of the crossing and to map the
video evidence onto it, as well as to help survivors walk us through the events, allowing them to place the incidents
on each side of the border.","There was secrecy and defensiveness on both the Morrocan and Spanish side around the border deaths, which meant we had to go to great lengths to obtain the information we needed. Spain essentially wanted to cover up the events and Morroco considers all its migration related security activities to be highly sensitive and confidential. It was extremely difficult to access the border post of Barrio Chino, our team was initially declined access by Spanish officers and even removed from the site during a visit with the EU Parliamentary left. It tooks months of work to persuade officers to give us a tour. The inside sources that agreed to speak with us on the Spanish side took great personal risks to do so and show us footage that no other journalists were able to see. On the Morrocan side, human rights activists warned us not to speak to any locals ourselves because that would put them at risk of retaliation by the country's security forces. Along with our Morrocan media partner, Enass, we had to be extremely cautious to make sure the victims we spoke to on the ground would not be at risk for agreeing to be interviewed.","The takeaway is that combining emerging techniques and working with newsrooms from different countries make these complex and highly sensitive investigations possible. Journalists can learn from the methods and technologies we used to create a timeline of events, to reconstruct the border post and to match videos filmed on the day onto it. The fact that we had journalists from both Spain and Morroco on the team meant that we had unique access to sources and inside knowledge on both sides and Le Monde's and Der Spiegel's commitment to the story helped other partners withstand internal pressures. None of the partners we worked with could have done an investigation on a topic this sensitive and obtained so much information individually. This is a great example of the practical and political gains that come with collaborations.","English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic",https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/reconstructing-the-melilla-massacre/,https://elpais.com/videos/2022-11-29/documental-tragedia-en-la-frontera-de-melilla-el-papel-de-marruecos-y-espana-en-las-muertes-del-24-j.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/international/video/2022/11/29/morts-de-dizaines-de-migrants-a-melilla-ce-qu-il-s-est-vraiment-passe-a-la-frontiere-entre-l-espagne-et-le-maroc_6152186_3210.html,https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/fluechtlinge-in-melilla-was-am-grenzzaun-wirklich-geschah-die-rekonstruktion-a-3c5e7ffa-6035-4a1f-bdc8-c2e1a92d90d3,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/melilla-spain-border-morocco-asylum-seekers-b2234673.html,,,"Jack Sapoch, Beatriz Ramalho da Silva, Bashar Deeb, Maud Jullien, Klaas van Dijken Arthur Weil-Rabaud, Aziz Alnour, Alison Killing, Javier Bauluz, Jos√© Bautista, Javier Bernardo, Maud Jullien, Salaheddine Lemaizi, Steffen L√ºdke, Mar√≠a Mart√≠n, Georgia Bempelou, Stefanos Bertakis, Javier G.

",Frontex Involved in Illegal Pushbacks of Hundreds of Refugees,28/04/2022,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, OSINT, Politics, Immigration, Human rights","Animation, Google Sheets","A joint investigation of Frontex‚Äôs internal database by Der Spiegel, Lighthouse Reports, SRF Rundschau, Republik and Le Monde ‚Äì shows that Frontex is implicated in illegal pushbacks of refugees in the Aegean Sea on a big scale.

Data recorded in its internal Joint Operations Reporting Application (JORA) database, when cross-referenced with other sources, indicates that Frontex was involved in at least 22 verifiable cases between March 2020 and September 2021. The real number is likely to be much higher. In the same time period, Frontex recorded its own role in 222 incidents involving 8,355 people.","Across Europe, mainly in German, Switzerland and France, hundreds of thousands users read or watched the investigation. It directly lead to the resgination of Fabrice Leggeri, who was Executive Director of Frontex at the time. Leggeri was forced to step back by the Management Board of the agency the day after the publication since the investigation showed that Frontex's involvement in illegal pushbacks was much bigger than previously proven. Leggeri had been under intense pressure due to other investigations by Lighthouse Reports, DER SPIEGEl and other partners.

The investigation and the downfall of Leggeri triggered headlines all over Europe. It put the Greek pushback campaign and the use of violence at EU borders into the spotlight. And it led to increased scrutiny by the European Parliament and Frontex having to proclaim a ""fresh start"" for the agency including a new leadership.","The reporters obtained the JORA database via a Freedom of Information Request. Frontex sent a redacted version of the database and deleted all descriptions of incidents, but accidentally provided descriptions for 145 incidents which took place in the Aegean between April and August 2020.

The database, in use by Frontex since 2011, includes more than one million lines and 137 columns. The reporters analysed the information contained and were able to identify reporting patterns which point to cases of pushbacks.

The incidents have an almost identical description: a Frontex asset (plane, helicopter, vessel or drone) detects a migrant boat crossing from Turkey and warns the Greek Coast Guard. The Coast Guard informs the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Greece and Turkey, after which the Turkish Coast Guard returns the boat to Turkey. The incidents are registered in JORA as ‚Äúprevention of departure‚Äù, and include the estimated number of people stopped from entering the EU, and a tick-box to signal Frontex involvement.

Cross-referencing incidents in JORA with those recorded in other databases, such as the Turkish Coast Guard‚Äôs or NGO reports, plus gathering additional visual evidence, we confirmed Frontex was involved in 22 pushbacks concerning 957 people. They were put in life-threatening situations on the open sea, left adrift on inflatable vessels without engines until the Turkish Coast Guard picked them up.

But between March 2020 and September 2021, Frontex was involved in a total of 222 incidents which it recorded as ‚Äúprevention of departure‚Äù, amounting to 8,355 people. Sources within Frontex, the Greek Coast Guard and the police all confirmed that the term ‚Äúprevention of departure‚Äù is used to indicate pushbacks.","Work on border violence and illegal pushbacks has become increasingly difficult in many states in the EU, especially in Greece. Reporters operate under the shadow of possible legal threats, law suits and public defamation campaigns. Frontex, on the other hand, is a notoriusly secret agency who is trying to limit its answers to FOIA requests to the bare minimum.",The investigation was built on top of several investigative cross-border projects that proved Frontex's involvement in illegal pushbacks. The investigative work started in spring 2020 and led to us having a superior understanding of how the pushbacks at sea work and what happened in specific incidents. The information gathered from the internal database was onl useful in combination with our knowledge and sources from past investigations.,"German, English",https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/frontex-involved-in-illegal-pushbacks-of-hundreds-of-refugees-a-9fe90845-efb1-4d91-a231-48efcafa53a0,https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/frontex-the-eu-pushback-agency/,https://www.republik.ch/2022/04/27/inside-frontex-die-geheime-datenbank-der-eu,https://www.srf.ch/news/abstimmungen-15-mai-2022/finanzierung-frontex/migration-frontex-in-pushbacks-in-aegaeis-involviert?wt_mc_o=srf.share.app.srf-app.unknown,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/28/revealed-eu-border-agency-involved-in-hundreds-of-refugee-pushbacks,https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/frontex-in-illegale-pushbacks-von-hunderten-fluechtlingen-involviert-a-086f0e5a-0172-4007-b59c-7bced325cc75,,"Emmanuel Freudenthal, Bashar Deeb, Gabriele Gatti, Francesca Pierigh, Htet Aung, Eva Constantaras, Klaas van Dijken, Jack Sapoch, Giorgos Christides, Steffen L√ºdke, Julia Pascual, Tomas Statius, Lukas H√§uptli, Michael Zollinger, Carlos Hanimann, Keto Schumacher","Lighthouse Reports is a non-profit investigative outlet that works with traditional media organizations to investigate and uncover wrongdoing.

United States,"The Associated Press, FRONTLINE",Big,Winner,"Wars are hideous moments of history. In wars with more civilian casualties, where basic civilian rules are disrespected, things are even more detrimental.

Showing war crimes is a way to reveal that it‚Äôs about way more than a power contest involving military forces. That‚Äôs what the Associated Press team presented in partnership with FRONTLINE.

In a war scene, between struggles to access information and, first of all, to confirm data which depends on government clearance that are contaminated by political interests, Journalism can fulfill a fundamental role allowing people to know about what is really happening.

The product complies with several requirements to be recognized as Data Journalism. Although it‚Äôs a hard subject, the team found interesting ways to present the history to the public. By using icons and filters resources, it allows to scale the problem. More than that, it presents proofs of each case quoted. It uses video, through the documentary, as a visual synthesis, by not letting any doubts that war crimes were committed. The special material is aligned to a trend of transparency, where the public was invited to know which was the methodology used to release the story.

It‚Äôs another example of great Journalism. It‚Äôs a reference. ",Putin's Attack on Ukraine: Documenting War Crimes,16/03/2022,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Video, Map, Satellite images, Audio, Agriculture, Crime, Human rights, Terrorism","3D modeling, Drone, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","The Associated Press and FRONTLINE spent 2022 documenting evidence of potential war crimes committed in Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine, and reporting on the atrocities and the search for justice. Just 30 days after the war started, we launched War Crimes Watch Ukraine, an interactive web experience where reporters documented visual evidence of targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure that likely violates the laws of war.","The reaction to this body of work has been widespread and ongoing. Early on, two groups affiliated with the U.S. State Department asked AP to meet about this work because they were impressed with our documentation and verification standards. 


An adviser to Ukrainian war crimes prosecutors told the AP, “You have described the beginning of the criminal enterprise and Putin’s role in it.” A team of lawyers pursuing civil litigation on destruction of property in Bucha said they are including the “Crime Scene: Bucha” video in their filing with the European Court of Human Rights. 


A prominent Russian dissident journalist living in Ukraine, Alexandr Nevzorov, urged his followers, “Watch without fail. Very strong but simple and intelligible material about Bucha. Created by the Associated Press. If anyone had any “doubts” about the criminality of Putinites there will be none left.” 


Ukrainian prosecutors increased their scrutiny of General Chaiko and his presence in Zdvyzhivka.","For War Crimes Watch Ukraine, AP and FRONTLINE built a database of wartime incidents that likely were violations of international humanitarian law and the laws of war. Reporters analyzed the open source images and claims using satellite imagery, facial recognition apps, reverse image searches and other open-source reporting techniques to verify that the images and claims were real. The database was built using a combination of Google Sheets and Airtable, a cloud collaboration platform made up of a database, a web interface that resembles a spreadsheet for reporters to use, and an API to support building external applications. 


We then built a public interface using a static site generator, Gatsby. Gatsby is based on React, a popular front end framework. These tools allowed for the application to be built efficiently and flexibly as the nature of the war in Ukraine and its crimes evolved. For instance, as we better understood the nature of the war crimes, we were able to dynamically add different facets and categorizations to incidents and display those with little additional work on the web application.
 
For Crime Scene Bucha, AP and FRONTLINE partnered with SITU Research and the Ukrainian citizen research group Jus Talionis to document the patterns of violence in the Ukrainian village. Over a period of weeks, researchers from Jus Talionis flew drones extensively documenting the city of Bucha. SITU took this unique city-wide dataset and built a digital model of the town and layered in evidence, including locations of bodies, CCTV footage of Russian soldiers, photographs from AP photographers and video from FRONTLINE filmmakers to create an immersive short documentary that shows the magnitude of the horror that befell this single community. This effort cost tens of thousands of dollars.","This was a true cross continental, multi-format effort that involved dozens of people from two news organizations. It demanded major coordination and also creativity.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, there was almost immediately a flood of visual evidence of potential war crimes appearing on social media. AP and FRONTLINE sought to verify what was happening to separate fact from hoax, and also to counter Russia‚Äôs efforts to deny what was happening. We moved quickly to train reporters both in reporting techniques that would allow them to verify events and claims using open source techniques, and also to familiarize the team with international humanitarian law and the laws of war. 

Just 30 days after the invasion, we launched War Crimes Watch Ukraine, an interactive web experience where reporters documented visual evidence of targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure that likely violates the laws of war. For ten months the catalog was updated daily. 

As our teams in the US and the Middle East worked from afar, AP‚Äôs investigative reporters and FRONTLINE‚Äôs film team went to Ukraine and worked with local staff to document the atrocities on the ground. AP reporter Erika Kinetz worked tirelessly to develop sources in Ukraine, an effort that eventually paid off when she obtained hundreds of hours of CCTV footage from the city of Bucha during Russia‚Äôs occupation and thousands of audio intercepts of Russian soldiers calling home and talking about their actions and the fighting conditions.","In the age of social media, journalists can report on and document events in faraway places and don‚Äôt have to be constrained by geography. However, that kind of reporting requires the same rigor and fact checking that on-site reporting requires. Using open source verification techniques and resources can allow that kind of rigor. Our reporters started with an image, video or claim found online, or in other news reports. They then used satellite imagery, Google maps and Google photos, reverse image searches, facial recognition apps and other techniques, along with traditional reporting via phone calls and interviews, to verify what they had found. 

In building War Crimes Watch Ukraine, AP and FRONTLINE created a data set that didn‚Äôt otherwise exist and we were able to use that to tell additional stories of the war. The database led directly to stories about hospital bombings, attacks on schools and their effect on children, and the destruction of energy infrastructure.

It also pays to weigh the best medium for each story. For the investigation into grain smuggling, for example, it was clear that visual storytelling that shows each step in the smuggling operation would be most revealing.",English,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interactive/ap-russia-war-crimes-ukraine/,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-lebanon-syria-87c3b6fea3f4c326003123b21aa78099,https://apnews.com/article/Ukraine-Russia-war-violence-investigation-1e242681582e523126456f1da8286661,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-e3756976cf33cf5de29aa62d61ea7eb6,https://apnews.com/article/bucha-ukraine-war-cleansing-investigation-43e5a9538e9ba68a035756b05028b8b4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW8YYhUIK0s,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/putins-attack-on-ukraine-documenting-war-crimes/,"Authors: Erika Kinetz, Tom Jennings, Sasha Stashevskiy, Annie Wong, Vasilisa Stepanenko, Michael Biesecker, Beatrice DuPuy, Sarah El Deeb.

We created an innovative web application ‚Äîinspired by the HBO television series ""Game of Thrones""‚Äîwhich investigates the connections between wealthy families and political campaigns. We reveal political clans' money trail and interests ahead of elections, aimed to captivate first-time voters. 

GoV exposes the candidates of these political Houses that seek a seat in Congress and are running for office. CP cross-referenced, analyzed, and visualized information from at least 22 databases in Colombia and abroad.","Game of Votes (GoV) was launched ten days before the congressional elections and was widely republished in local media, precisely in the influence region of the Political Houses investigated. Cuesti√≥n P√∫blica's team participated in two Instagram live shows hosted by three popular Instagrammers to disclose the GoV's findings. The shows reached 3,500 people in real-time.

The Game of Votes app's release put on the media agenda the political dynasties/houses candidates in the Congress elections. Four mainstream and independent media outlets covered this topic ahead of legislative polls after our publication.

Three regional media outlets republished our investigations according to the 'house' of influence in their territories: Atl√°ntico, Magdalena, and Norte de Santander departments.

Regarding presidential elections, we introduced ""The Game"" containing two interactive tools for both runoffs to help citizens create their presidential election forecast. Those tools had 3.6K unique visitors to the page.

Furthermore, we paid for digital advertising ‚ÄîInstagram & Facebook‚Äî published in the regions where these political families/houses have territory control (Atl√°ntico, Magdalena, Norte de Santander, Santander, Valle del Cauca, Sucre, Antioquia, C√≥rdoba, and Bol√≠var). Our information reached young and first-time voters between 18 and 34 years old.

Digital advertising obtained an average of 300 to 350 thousand impressions on social media. Ads reached 47% of men and 36% of women between 18 and 34 years old. In addition, we advertised in an independent digital media outlet with more than 500K followers on Instagram, whose audience is composed mainly of young people.
In some way, the GoV application helped citizens unveil the traditional political houses punished in the ballots. The actual Congress is composed of a greater plurality of political forces.

This app has hit 41.9K unique visitors to the whole GoV website.","The Game of Votes (GoV) application was built in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Next framework. GoV wireframes were created in Figma. A UX/IU designer worked for three weeks to design and improve the platform's user experience.

For the ""Game"" section, we used Power BI as a tool for the 2022 first presidential runoff and our in-house development for the second one.
We created a database to track networks, members, enterprises, public resources, and candidates of Political Houses. We cross-referenced it with different public databases to identify connections between their members (relatives, allies, associates) and, government branches & control entities, and local public procurement. In addition, we published findings on abuses and irregularities in public resources.

Cuesti√≥n P√∫blica scrapped open government databases, through R and Python scripts, for the massive extraction of information on public contracting and Congress bills.

The consolidated data of each Political House was compiled in Google Sheets files to facilitate the visualization of information and content control by journalists and editors and its integration with the web platform. 

 The Google Sheets connected to a test environment where we made all changes and updates on it before migrating to the public web application page. We could do this thanks to a script written in the Google Apps Script environment that works as a custom API for the data. Besides, we created a 'custom' application to cross-reference our reference list with the Colombian Electronic Public Procurement System procurement through an API.

A video producer made the GoV trailer video in 3D modeling based on HBO's Game of Thrones intro. A Colombian musician recorded the original ""Game of Thrones"" song in Colombian Caribbean folklore ‚ÄîVallenato‚Äî version and granted us its use for the main video of ""Game of Votes.""","For generations, political families have controlled territories in Colombia. They have maintained their power through the accumulation of money, abuse of power, and holding public resources management.

Through organized structures of politicians, business people, contractors, political cronyism, and, in some cases, paramilitaries and drug traffickers, a few families - political clans - who own large tracts of land have appropriated public business and the administration of the resources of the cities, the regions, and the Nation.

In a medieval universe, GoV shows how the clans manage to stay in power over time; how their relatives and allies are strategically placed in public positions in all branches of power; how the members of these political structures sign contracts while their partners or relatives govern; exposes the interests of the Houses in the economic sectors, their business assets and points out their nepotism.

Every election year, the same clans return with their ‚Äî""Trojan horses""‚Äî candidates to obtain votes ‚Äîwith questionable practices‚Äî and hold power without changes, which is an obstacle to new local leaderships.

The Colombian National Streak in 2021 was a turning point in the political spectrum. Protests were led by young people fighting against rising inequality, police brutality, and abuse of power during the Iv√°n Duque presidential term. Most of them were first-time voters. For this reason, young people gained importance during elections.

Game of Votes (GoV) translates to young citizens, the power game played by political houses running for general and local elections. We crossed popular cultural symbols ‚ÄîGame of Thrones and Colombian Caribbean folklore music‚Äî with political reality to expose the mighty political families controlling territories and reach a younger audience, determining the 2022 election results in Colombia.

GoV explained the complex phenomenon of power accumulation and political-business structures in a way that is understandable to a citizen, how their vote contributes to the powerful machinery of these families.

After publishing, we were disturbed by two people involved in our investigation. They requested to be retired from the Political House's network in our publication because it affected their reputation. Supported by our methodology, we refused any changes. 

For this investigation, Cuesti√≥n P√∫blica explored campaign funding, public contracts of the Political House's members, the clan's companies in Colombia and abroad, the criminal activities documented in their environments, and the ""jobs for mates"" of those who participated in the 2022 elections that defined the political course of the country.

In 2022, a leftist president won office for the first time in Colombia.","There are many lessons. The Game of Votes application was designed for mobile-first use; this is part of its success. We added a user-centered design to optimize displaying information and enhance user experience. Inspired by a medieval universe, we handled to engage a young audience curious about political and electoral issues in an innovative approach. Crossing popular culture and data-investigative journalism without losing rigor is a winning product that new audiences appreciate and consume.

Another lesson is to be inspired by gamification functions. The Game of Votes app displays data visualizations to explain simply the complex phenomenon of the accumulation of power in the Political Houses in Colombia. This application makes it easy for citizens to consume a large amount of data and information collected, organized, analyzed, and investigated through a unique methodology that combines classic investigative journalism, data-driven journalism, OSINT techniques, and a legal filter. GoV integrates 499 nodes of people and 316 companies.

Taking advantage of the new HBO TV series ""House of the Dragons"" hype, we created TikTok and Reel videos of some GoV Political Houses to increase engagement with the app and its information ‚Äîeven after Congress and the Presidential elections‚Äî.

United States,"Grist (main outlet), Voice of OC (publishing partner)",Small,Winner,"When Grist reporter Yvette Cabrera took more than 1,600 soil samples in Santa Ana , Calif., she found that more than half of them collected in the lowest-income areas contained contaminants considered  unsafe for children. The story of soil contamination and air pollution from nearby highways  in the Logan barrio could have stopped there. But Cabrera went further, using historical deed restrictions, zoning regulations and other archives to show how policies implemented throughout the industrial era created systematic discrimination against people of color, barring them from healthier neighborhoods and isolating them in the harmful pollution.",Ghosts of Polluters Past,13/01/2022,"Investigation, Long-form, Environment, Health","QGIS, R, Python, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer, Tableau, Mapbox, SVG, HTML/CSS/JavaScript","Centuries of industrialization and racial inequities have shaped American cities. Minority communities have long found themselves segregated to areas zoned for the heaviest-impact industrial uses -- and they‚Äôve suffered, with high rates of cancer, asthma, and cognitive impairments.
 
In ‚ÄúGhosts of Polluters Past,‚Äù Grist‚Äôs Yvette Cabrera and Clayton Aldern paint a poignant portrait of the Mexican-American Logan neighborhood of Santa Ana, California, and its residents‚Äô multigenerational struggle to fight industrial pollution that blighted their livelihoods.","Alongside calls from residents, the project, published in partnership with the nonprofit news site Voice of OC, prompted the Santa Ana city council to approve a plan in April that commits to comprehensively address lead contamination hazards. The work also provides a model for how enterprising journalists can uncover the hidden history of relic industrial sites and soil-lead contamination, making it accessible to residents and empowering them to take control of their environment. The series received the 2022 Breaking Barriers Award from the Institute for Nonprofit News, awarded annually for ‚Äúreporting that brought new understanding to an issue affecting people who are historically underrepresented, disadvantaged or marginalized, resulting in impactful change.‚Äù","""Ghosts of Polluters Past"" and its partner story, ""Toxic Churn,"" combine original soil sample collection, innovative spatial data analysis, archival work, academic and scientific partnerships, and classic shoe leather reporting to produce a humanizing, yet data-forward look at the hidden threat of lead contamination in the soil of America's cities.
 
Yvette Cabrera spent five years independently gathering and analyzing more than 1,600 soil samples, as well as combing through six decades of historical business directories and industrial siting and zoning data. Her richly detailed research and reporting, aided by Clayton Aldern‚Äôs data analysis and visualization, revealed that more than half of the samples she collected in the city‚Äôs poorest neighborhoods contained levels of lead that California considers unsafe for children. Through historical documents, she traced Santa Ana‚Äôs legacy of discriminatory policies (including racial covenants) that exposed areas such as Logan to freeway emissions and polluting industries. To convey the findings in question, the team conducted a series of spatial interpolations and regressions on Cabrera‚Äôs raw data, thereby generating ‚Äòhot spots‚Äô that lent themselves to a bold visual treatment.
 
In ‚ÄúToxic Churn,‚Äù Cabrera and Aldern apply their findings, outlining how the toxic legacy of historical industry in urban neighborhoods has largely escaped regulatory scrutiny throughout the United States. Because of the way small industrial operations spread through urban areas during the 20th century without any oversight, many (perhaps most) city dwellers unknowingly live in neighborhoods burdened by toxic contaminants ‚Äì like lead, arsenic, and cadmium ‚Äì which remain in soil long after the businesses that dumped them are gone. Via temporal and spatial statistics, Cabrera and Aldern illustrate how official databases (like the EPA‚Äôs Toxics Release Inventory) represent drastic undercounts of this cumulative pollution.","Santa Ana is a city of 335,000 people in Orange County, California. Its population is more than 75 percent Latino. It‚Äôs been nearly a century since the city zoned the already-established residential barrio of Logan for industrial use. As the neighborhood‚Äôs agricultural roots gave way to industry, products like petroleum, aviation gasoline, lead ore, heavy metals, chemicals, herbicides, and pesticides came and went on the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroad lines ‚Äî but a part of them never left.
 
Today, the Logan census tract is identified as a ‚Äúdisadvantaged community‚Äù by the state Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs environmental health screening tool because it‚Äôs among California‚Äôs most pollution-burdened areas. While generations of Mexican Americans battled the encroachment of industry in the Logan barrio and won several major victories, the neighborhood remains filled with scrap yards, recycling centers, auto repair shops, and other industrial and commercial businesses that continue to take their toll on the neighborhood.
 
As in other urban centers across the country throughout the 20th century, city leaders‚Äô decisions transformed Santa Ana‚Äôs built environment, leaving a cumulative legacy of lead contamination in neighborhoods where Mexicans and Mexican Americans were forced by segregation, discrimination, and historical social norms to live during the first half of the 20th century ‚Äî and where Latino residents continue to reside today.","Yvette Cabrera has been reporting on Santa Ana‚Äôs lead contamination for more than five years, and over that time she has continuously dug deeper into both the community and the issues it faces. This project is a reflection of those years of cultivating deep source relationships with residents, nonprofits, and community leaders. Her pairing up with Grist data reporter Clayton Aldern allowed Cabrera to tell not just the human and justice story, but to use original empirical research to create a piece of journalism capable of influencing real change ‚Äì which we saw by the city council‚Äôs response last year.",English,https://grist.org/project/equity/california-lead-soil/,https://grist.org/project/equity/california-lead-soil-historical/,https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=335591865239104,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnMggSaNXWM,,,,Yvette Cabrera & Clayton Aldern,"Yvette is a former senior staff writer at Grist, where she reported on the intersection of of justice, equity, and the environment.

What the Markup's Still Loading project did was quantify those disparities, and show how they disproportionately affect poorer neighborhoods and communities of color.  It showed the injustice didn't stop there: slow internet connections cost the same as fast ones, meaning communities are disadvantaged twice. In laying out the scale and inequity of the issue, the Markup did outstanding work in the public interest.

And for interactives: Kepler, Datawrapper, and JavaScript.","An investigation by The Markup found that AT&T, Verizon, EarthLink, and CenturyLink disproportionately offered lower-income and least-White neighborhoods slow internet service for the same price as speedy connections they offered in other parts of town. The project includes our main investigative story, methodology, and story recipe. We also updated an earlier story called ‚ÄúWhy Is My Internet So Slow?‚Äù to include more specific information to help consumers.","Following publication, the reaction to this story was overwhelming. The Markup reporters Leon Yin and Aaron Sankin were interviewed on national public radio shows like Marketplace Tech, On The Media, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and All Things Considered. They were invited to give presentations to the National Digital Inclusion Alliance and have briefed local, federal, and state-level lawmakers and regulators about our findings.

Leon and Aaron also created a guide showing other journalists how to localize the story for their own communities, which many publications did. Dozens more republished the story, mostly through The Markup‚Äôs partnership with the Associated Press. Aaron also updated a story he wrote earlier in the year to add explanations on how individuals can check if they‚Äôre able to switch to another internet provider and get better speeds, and how people might be eligible for a monthly subsidy to help with their internet bill.

The investigation has also proved a crucial resource for government officials working to bring more Americans online. Detroit‚Äôs director of digital inclusion told The Markup that the data would help the city decide which neighborhoods to prioritize for the construction of its in-progress open-access municipal fiber network. 

The investigation also came as the Federal Communications Commission is in the midst of a rulemaking process aimed at ‚Äúpreventing digital discrimination.‚Äù This process gives the agency broad leeway to take action to rectify digital inequality. Our reporting has the potential to directly influence this rulemaking process‚Äîespecially since the story and data were formally submitted for consideration by the California Community Foundation.","Our data collection method is modeled on a 2020 Princeton study that used an often overlooked information source: the ‚Äúbroadband availability tools‚Äù from internet service providers‚Äô own websites. We used those lookup tools‚Äîby finding and using the underlying APIs‚Äîto collect granular information on internet plans offered by ISPs to individual addresses. This allowed us to join information about price and offered speed with the socioeconomic data of the surrounding area and test for patterns among consumers receiving the worst value for the same monthly fee. 

Between April 15 and Oct. 1, 2022, we gathered internet offers from AT&T‚Äôs, Verizon‚Äôs, EarthLink‚Äôs, and CenturyLink‚Äôs websites for 1.1 million U.S. residential addresses for 45 cities that we had collected from open sources. We focused on the largest city served by at least one of the four ISPs in each state. 

We used Census block group data and historical redlining maps, where available, to determine the socioeconomic characteristics of areas that were disproportionately offered the worst deals. To do this, we grouped addresses by their area‚Äôs median income, racial/ethnic demographics, and redlining grades to compare the proportion of slow speeds offered to each of these groups for each city and ISP. 

In addition, we conducted a logistic regression to determine whether business factors such as competition and customer adoption (explanations that ISPs have said play a role in where they choose to upgrade equipment) affected the disparities in who got the worst offers. Even after adjusting for these factors, lower-income, least-White, and historically redlined areas still got the worst offers in the vast majority of cities we examined.","We filed 46 public records requests asking cities, states, and counties across the country to provide any franchise agreements they had with the internet service providers that were the subject of our investigation. The initial goal was to determine if any of these providers were violating the terms of their franchise agreements by offering inequitable service across a municipality.

Through this process we learned that internet service is not regulated at the local level, as is cable service. None of the cities provided franchise agreements that covered internet service, even though there were agreements with some of the companies covering cable service. 

There were also challenges with gathering the data.

**Address data difficulties**: For each address we gathered from OpenAddresses and NYC Open Data, we identified both its Census block group and whether it was within the boundaries of the city by plugging its coordinates into the Census.gov geocoder API. We chose this approach because zip codes or city names were often absent from the open-source data we used.

**Address selection difficulties**: For each city and ISP, we went through each Census block group and took a random 10 percent sample of the addresses we had collected (called a stratified sampling). If a lookup tool told us that an address was not served, or invalid, we continued to search new addresses until we reached a 10 percent sample of each block group. This is how we collected a representative sample of offers (speed and price) for each city and ISP in our investigation.

**Difficulties with historical redlining maps**: We relied on the University of Richmond‚Äôs Mapping Inequality project, an online repository of residential ‚Äúmortgage security‚Äù maps and other associated documents from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), to categorize historically redlined neighborhoods. We merged HOLC grades to addresses by checking if an address‚Äôs coordinates fell within the boundaries of graded areas to which we had access. The digitized maps don‚Äôt include every map created by the HOLC, since some were never digitized by the researchers at Mapping Inequality. Further, some cities in our data were never mapped by the HOLC. As a result, we have maps for only 22 cities. 

**Data gathering difficulties**: ISPs make the process of querying an address a slow and multistep process; they also block IP addresses that make too many sequential requests. We reverse-engineered their websites by finding and using up to five APIs that make up the process of querying an address for internet plans. To prevent overloading the ISP servers or getting our queries rejected, requests were delayed and routed through a network of residential IPs provided to The Markup by The Bright Initiative.","All of the data collected for the story was published to The Markup‚Äôs GitHub page, and The Markup also published the methodology for the investigation alongside the story. We hope that our transparency at every level of this project helps cement showing your work as an industry standard, especially because it helps newsrooms without the same resources or access.

We also wanted to make sure we got our findings into the hands of local reporters and to carve out time to help them publish their own stories. First, we loaded the address-level data into interactive maps and produced granular and summarized output files organized by city and provider. Then, alongside Leon and Aaron‚Äôs investigation, we published a how-to guide (a ‚Äústory recipe‚Äù) so that local journalists could use our findings, combine it with their own reporting, and get more specific, localized reports to their readers. We‚Äôve been in awe at the impact we‚Äôve seen from helping local reporters parse this data we wrangled, including in the comments from their readers expressing that they‚Äôve long suspected internet inequities and now finally have something to affirm their suspicions.",English,https://themarkup.org/still-loading/2022/10/19/dollars-to-megabits-you-may-be-paying-400-times-as-much-as-your-neighbor-for-internet-service,https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2022/10/19/how-we-uncovered-disparities-in-internet-deals,https://themarkup.org/story-recipes/2022/10/19/journalists-investigate-which-neighborhoods-in-your-city-are-offered-the-worst-internet-deals,https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2022/04/12/why-is-my-internet-so-slow,,,,"Leon Yin, Aaron Sankin, Evelyn Larrubia, Joel Eastwood, Gabriel Hongsdusit, Paroma Soni, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Maria Puertas, Jill Jaroff","Leon Yin (primary reporter, investigative data reporter)

The investigation found that the country's critical infrastructures, the most vulnerable neighborhoods and the wealthiest ones are at risk of being flooded if the effects of climate change are not curbed.
Amenaza Roboto's team developed a data analysis methodology that uncovered relevant information for citizens hidden in public documents of the Uruguayan State. 
This investigation inaugurated the data and climate journalism vertical of Amenaza Roboto.","This is the data and climate journalism project with the greatest social and media impact in the history of Uruguay. 

**I) Awards.** ‚ÄúThe submerged city‚Äù won the Open Climate Data Contest organized by the Ministry of the Environment, Agesic, Open Data Charter and the Inter-American Development Bank. This investigation laid the groundwork for our next project which has already won the Pulitzer Center‚Äôs new reporting grant that focuses on climate change and its effects on workers and work.

**II) Presentation before authorities.** Our investigation was presented at Torre Ejecutiva, headquarters of the Executive Branch of Uruguay, where the offices of the Presidency of the Republic are located.

**III) Academia.** ""The submerged city"" was presented in the master 's degree in Journalism Innovation at the Miguel Hern√°ndez University (Spain). The results were also presented at ORT University (Uruguay), INPE (Instituto de Pesquisas Espaciais, Brazil), and at the ""18th International gvSIG Conference and the GeoLIBERO 2022 Conference"" of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain).

**V) Regional impact.** We have distributed the results of our research at a regional level in podcast format (According to Spotify‚Äôs Wrapped: our podcast has been in the top 15% of the most listened to in the world)

**VI) International impact.** The Reuters Institute and the World Federation of Science Journalists have shared our work on social media.

**VII) Open Data.** We‚Äôve created a GitHub so colleagues, academics and authorities can check or source the open databases that we‚Äôve used, and the open data that's a direct product of our research.","One of the objectives of the present investigation was to calculate the population exposed to flood hazard due to sea level rise in Montevideo. We used data downloaded from the National Environmental Observatory (Ministry of Environment of Uruguay), the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the Ministry of Social Development, Municipality of Montevideo, among others. Flood surfaces were extracted from the National Adaptation Plan to climate change and variability of coastal zones in Uruguay (2021) report. The investigation was conducted in four stages: (1) data acquisition, (2) development of an integrated database; (3) generation of thematic maps; (4) narrative.
 
In the first stage, data relating to population by age and genre, flooding surfaces under maximum climatic scenarios, infrastructure, and irregular settlements were aggregated. Infrastructure and demographic data were georeferenced by using ArcGIS software. Data acquired from the above sources were used to develop an integrated database (2). Gathered data were linked with population grids according to the territorial division system applied by INE. Information from the 2004 and 2011 census were intersected to reclassify boundaries of the population grid cells not available in the 2011 dataset. The results of the analyses conducted in the previous stages were visualized on thematic maps (3). Kernel density, raster reclassify, and raster calculator tools were used for this purpose. All the information was reclassified on the same scale by using geographic information system (GIS) software. Thematic maps represent the intersection of demographic and infrastructure dataset with the flooding surfaces calculated for 2100 from RCP 8.5 pathways for a 500-years return period. The maps generated were finally integrated with the interviews to scientists and representatives of governmental agencies and the review of the public information (4). The GIS project and full dataset were published in an open data repository (GitHub).","Although Uruguay has good international indicators of open government data, it is hard for citizens to access relevant and updated databases. In addition, if the data exists and is accessible (as it was in the case of our investigation), the necessary technical capacities to process it are not usually available. If we add to these difficulties, the approach to complex issues such as climate change, the mission becomes even harder. 

In the context of a climate and open data contest organized by Open Data Charter, The Inter-American Development Bank, the Ministry of Environment of Uruguay and AGESIC (Uruguay‚Äôs e-Government Agency), we assembled an interdisciplinary and multicultural team (with professionals from Uruguay, Argentina and Mexico), unusual by the standards of not only local but also Latin American media. Our media organization is staffed with journalists, geologists and data scientists that use cutting edge methods to collect and analyze evidence to show how climate change will affect different communities of Uruguayan.","Journalism exists to serve the public. In the Global South, small newsrooms have the chance to cover what big media outlets can‚Äôt. Through our work in Amenaza Roboto, other colleagues can learn to develop climate and data-driven research units. 

From our investigations, local, regional and internationals media outlets can learn:
I) How to build an MVP team.
II) How to integrate scientists from different backgrounds to the day-to-day journalism process. 
III) How to work ethically with open-data.
III) How to publish the underlying datasets that are used in investigations, as well as a detailed methodology describing the data, its provenance and the statistical techniques used in analysis.
IV) How academics, journalists, policymakers, and community organizers can better engage with the findings of the investigations.
V) How to serve as a tool to empower and promote behavioral changes in society based on the appropriation of a problem. In this context, the dissemination of the effects of Climate Change aimed to place the populations involved as relevant actors, integrating them along with technical knowledge into the sphere of political decision making.","Spanish, English",https://www.amenazaroboto.com/uruguay2100/montevideo,https://www.amenazaroboto.com/uruguay2100/montevideo/eng,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AIHtT5rLN4-gj1Ch2oYW5AD_ACeJAa-Y?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvfzbI0XkeKDxNYYV49XKSwEVRW1sNC2/view?usp=share_link,https://github.com/AmenazaRoboto/Uruguay2100,,,"Gabriel Far√≠as

Through extensive reporting across the five boroughs, the story also showed how the city‚Äôs efforts to reduce the dangers posed by cars outside schools have been insufficient, leaving children vulnerable in places where they have no choice but to be.","Following the release of this story:
The city Department of Transportation announced plans to redesign streets outside schools in poor communities of color to make them safer.
The governor of New York cited the story's findings when signing a bill to expand a school-zone speed camera program in New York City.
The mayor of New York City and the city‚Äôs top transportation official said the city must do more to keep children safe from cars outside schools.
Local lawmakers expressed outrage about the story‚Äôs findings and called on the city to do more to protect children from cars outside schools.","This story is built on an analysis of more than a dozen datasets and other data sources published by New York City, most on its open data portal. Using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS, and Excel, Coburn merged these disparate data sources into a novel database that listed every car crash near a New York City public school since July 2015‚Äîexcluding the first 15 months of the pandemic, when city students were largely learning remotely‚Äîas well as information on the enrollment and demographics of each school. This yielded startling insights into the dangers that children face navigating city streets on their way to and from school every day.

To begin, Coburn acquired and cleaned datasets on: car crashes in the city; the locations, enrollment and demographics of more than 1,000 city schools across six school years; and school calendars, which Coburn had to scrape from PDFs. He then wrote a 70-line Postgres query to join all this data into a single database. For every car crash in the city since July 2015, excluding the early pandemic period, the database indicates whether the crash occurred within 250 feet of a school, whether it occurred during student arrival and departure hours, and how many poor, non-white, and total students were enrolled in each school at the time.

The database required extensive cleaning before it could be analyzed. For example, Coburn had to manually reclassify crashes that occurred near schools but posed no threat to pedestrians or cyclists, such as those on grade-separated highways. Finalizing the data took weeks.

Once finished, this database led to previously unknown discoveries about the extent of traffic violence around schools, including that there are 57% more crashes and 25% more injuries per mile on school streets than other city streets at 8 a.m. on school days, and that injury rates from car crashes are 43% higher outside majority Black or brown schools than majority-white schools.

Coburn also created interactive maps for the story using Tableau.","New York City agencies were hostile to Streetsblog‚Äôs efforts to examine the threat that cars pose to children outside city-run schools. The city departments of transportation and education declined to make any officials available for interviews or to answer many questions for the story. The Department of Education even kicked Streetsblog out of a press conference instead of answering basic questions about the dangers children face walking to and from city schools (link: https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/department-of-education-kicks-streetsblog-out-of-media-event-instead-of-answering-question-on-school-street-safety/).

We also geolocated all of the sites listed on UNESCO‚Äôs compilation of damaged cultural monuments and buildings (there were about 170 in August, 2022), in order to map just how widespread this damage was across Ukraine. For several of the worst hit sites, we obtained satellite images and Google street view images to show them before and after the destruction.

The work inspired similar work on the same topic from other visual teams around the world.","For this project, we relied almost entirely on open-source software in the processing of the point cloud data, the 3D modelling and also for the front-end visualisations.

We used Cloud Compare(CC), both the GUI and command line interface (CLI), to drastically reduce the size of the point cloud data. The file size for each building capture was around 1.5 gigabytes or more than 1 billion points. Obviously, displaying data of that size would be nearly impossible in the browser, so we used Cloud Compare‚Äôs CLI to write a script that reduced the number of points in the files so that data points were no closer than a few centimetres to each other. In the original file, some points were as close as a few millimetres apart. 

We then converted the files to a more common point cloud filetype (LAS/LAZ) and brought that into CC‚Äôs software that allowed us to tidy up the noise in the model, remove any unnecessary areas that had been captured and also run an ambient occlusion filter over the model to enhance its colours and shading.

This whole process whittled the file size, for each building, down to about 20mb/1 million points rather than 1.5gb/ 1 billion plus points.

We then used the LAStools software suite to split the data into tiles so that we could load the file in chunks rather than forcing our audience to wait for the whole thing to load at one time.

This project was then brought into ThreeJS, where we modelled what the users would see as they scrolled through the piece.

We also used QGIS to map the sites on UNESCOs list of damaged cultural sites, as well as processing satellite images.

Adobe Illustrator and Blender were also used.","One of the biggest challenges we faced bringing this story to life was that none of us had done much work visualising point cloud data in the browser. We have little to no budget, so everything we created had to be in house and open source. We had experience creating and visualising 3D models, but in the past we had presented that data as image sequences or videos rendered from Blender or other 3D software. For this piece, we wanted to present the data in its purest format - the point cloud. This approach brought with it a whole series of challenges.

The first were the enormous file sizes, which we tackled using the approach I listed above. Then, we didn‚Äôt want our audience to have to wait for the whole file to load, so we came up with a way to split the data into tiles, so it could load in smaller sections at a time which meant people could see the models constructing themselves while they read through the story.

This meant the piece worked smoothly across all devices, mobile and desktop and through relatively poor internet connections as well.

The geolocation of damaged cultural sites was a significant undertaking as the location of sites wasn‚Äôt immediately obvious from the names supplied on the UNESCO list. For various reasons simply googling the name of the site to find the location was not always an option. We often had to trawl through social media, scour local news reports, check satellite imagery and cross check locations with sites listed on the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture‚Äôs own database.

We then used these sites and matched them up with satellite images and Google street view (a painstaking task in itself) to present before and after images for several of the worst hit sites across Ukraine.","Two of the big takeaways for other journalists for the piece are:

1. We did this using entirely open-source software and code libraries. So everything we did could be entirely recreated without any budget constraints, other than the time it took us to pull it all together.
2. The other is that, at the beginning of this project none of us were 3D experts. But we were able to get our heads around the various different programs available and pull everything together.

Norway,NRK,Big,Winner,"This entry turned an in-depth, technical investigation into how TikTok's algorithm shows or hides videos about the war against Ukraine, based on where people live, into a beautiful, organic, and captivating presentation. Despite going into it expecting the result (that young men in Russia do not see TikTok videos about the war), seeing the side-by-side comparison of what TikTok showed to different users based on geography was striking and emotionally resonate. ",Worlds Apart,05/04/2022,"Investigation, OSINT, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Python, Selenium, Azure Computer Vision API, Elasticsearch, Kibana.","When Russia went to war against Ukraine and the media withdrew from the area, the dance app TikTok suddenly became an important channel for news from the war.
But did TikTok show the war to everyone? With the help of innovative and advanced programming, artificial intelligence, local proxies and a good dose of creativity, NRK was able to send TikTok robots to the war zone to document what the Chinese company showed young men in the neighboring cities of Belgorod (Russia) and Kharkiv (Ukraine).
Finally we could reveal that TikTok did not show the war to its Russian users.","The article has around 360,000 readers in Norway. It also went viral and was translated by various users all over the world. Therefore, we also made an English version to ensure that the translation was correct. This meant that we reached a new 85,000 readers and received, among other things, a recommendation in the New York Times newsletter.
The fact that the case received so much attention abroad also led to several people contacting us to learn more about how we worked or to offer cooperation. We have held a number of lectures for data journalists in Norway, Sweden and Germany. We have also shared our methods in an interview with the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN).
Since publication, TikTok has quietly started showing new videos from both Russian and international users ‚Äì completely contrary to what has been the company's stance externally.","First of all, we used ""residential proxies"" to make the TikTok algorithms believe that our traffic came from the Russian border city of Belgorod and the Ukrainian border city of Kharkiv.
The next step was to build a TikTok bot with the Python programming language that could scroll through thousands of records and extract information. This was very challenging, since TikTok has strict monitoring of all activity, and kicks out users who engage in bot-like behavior.
It quickly became clear that the Ukrainian bot got to see videos from the war from the start, while the Russian one didn't see a single tank. We therefore tried to ""help"" the Russian bot to see more of the war.
TikTok's algorithm works in such a way that you train it to serve more of what you like. We therefore collected subject tags and keywords that were associated with the war. In addition, we used Microsoft's tool Azure Computer Vision, which is an artificial intelligence that can look at images and provide a description of what is in the image. We fed this AI words like guns, tanks, the military, soldiers, explosions and so on. Then we programmed the bot to look longer at videos that contained the topic tags and keywords we had collected or images that the AI recognized.
Yet the war never appeared in Russia. We then tried via our proxy in Russia to view the videos of acts of war that the Ukrainian bot had seen, but it was not possible. So we could state that TikTok does not show the war to its Russian users.","Ethical considerations

Use of videos from TikTok
We wanted to show readers a selection of the actual videos TikTok served to the Russian and Ukrainian user. Especially the very first videos the bots saw, because already there we saw a huge difference. We believe we can use the news right to show the videos, because it is very important to make people understand how the algorithms help to give people in Russia and Ukraine a different picture of the war. The videos were also publicly available to everyone. However, it has been important to carefully go through each video to be shown, and assess how much of, among other things, faces, text and recognizable features/clothing that we can show. For example, one of the first videos shows a child donning military gear. Here we have covered the face, and we have also done this in many of the other videos. We have gone carefully 9 through all vid

Fake users
We violate TikTok's guidelines when we create fake users and create software that automatically scrolls through TikTok. We did it anyway, because we believe it is important that someone checks and shows how the algorithms work. TikTok is also an important source of news for young people in particular ‚Äì in our case young men who have to decide whether to participate in a war. It is critical for democracy and society that citizens understand how the algorithms determine what content you get in your feed.

Residential proxies
Residential proxies make it possible to ""trick"" a website or service into thinking you are somewhere else in the world than you really are. It is more difficult to see through residential proxies than, for example, VPN solutions, because the internet traffic goes through the IP address of a regular internet user. However, this also creates ethical challenges. An internet user can potentially share internet traffic with others without knowing it. It would have been very unfortunate if NRK contributed to something like this. Therefore, it was important for us to use one of the largest providers of such services, even if this also meant one of the most expensive.","How to tell a data story?
It is nice to have a lot of data, but in order for many people to take it in, you must also be able to communicate it in a good way. That's why we thought about the storytelling right from the start. The reason why we sent the bots to Belgorod and Kharkiv was that we had navigated the Russian-Ukrainian border in Google Maps to find war-affected cities in Ukraine that had a Russian city just over the border. This geographical proximity (only 8 miles between the towns) gave a stronger nerve than if we had covered the whole country. We also chose to let our own work process play an important role in the matter. That way the reader could join in and see how we built the bots, what kind of properties we gave them, how things changed when we changed the settings and how different videos the bots Alexei and Nykolai got.
It was also a point that the reader should feel that he or she was in the TikTok universe. That's why we chose a presentation template where you scroll down one card at a time - just like in the TikTok app.

But those effects are still largely invisible. We traveled to two of the hottest cities in the world ‚Äî Kuwait City and Basra, Iraq ‚Äî to measure the toll that extreme heat already takes on people‚Äôs health, their cities and their lives. Through a rich combination of on-the-ground reporting, video and sensor journalism ‚Äî including heat loggers, thermal imaging, temperature probes and heart rate monitors ‚Äî we offer readers a unusually personal glimpse of what the future will look like.","The effects of extreme heat are largely invisible, even to those who experience them. Years of exposure to high temperatures can silently lead to kidney problems, heart problems and other health issues. This project went to extraordinary lengths to make the risks clear, showing the promise of combining sensor reporting with rich narrative journalism.

Teju Cole wrote that the piece is ‚Äúimpressive and helpful, particularly for the way it focuses attention on concrete examples: two cities (Basra and Kuwait City), and on two individuals.‚Äù

Michael Oppenheimer, a prominent climate researcher, wrote that the piece was a ‚Äúshocking visual preview from places where the future is now.‚Äù

The impact may seem simple, but it is in fact difficult ‚Äî making the danger of something you may know intellectually really hit home. To do this, the project used elements that are rarely combined: personal, narrative writing; sensor journalism; explanatory video; and data visualization. It was a measure of the project‚Äôs success that these elements felt seamless.

‚ÄúLove the integration of video and temp data in the piece,‚Äù wrote Jeff Goodwell, an environmental journalist at Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúThis is where journalism is headed.‚Äù","This story weaved together video and on-the-ground reporting, video and the novel use of sensor journalism to capture the hyperlocal conditions across each city.

We worked for months with heat researchers, doctors, climate scientists and other researchers to carefully design our reporting and measurement protocol and make sure our use of these measurements was scientifically appropriate.

We carried a data logger everywhere we went to capture the air temperature and humidity at each location we visited. These loggers captured measurements every 15 seconds and stored them in CSV files with timestamps. By combining these readings with the metadata of the video files, we could report the exact conditions our subjects were experiencing while we filmed them. 

To add to our understanding of the pernicious effects of heat, we used a combination of thermal imaging cameras and a temperature gun to capture the surface temperature of objects in our subject‚Äôs environment, such as scaldingly hot metal benches and a children‚Äôs swing that reached 180¬∞F. 

Working closely with several experts who study heat exposure, we also estimated the effect that this extreme heat was having on our subject‚Äôs bodies. We fitted a welder with a heart rate monitor while to estimate how his core body temperature rose while he worked in direct sunlight as the feels-like temperature reached 125¬∞F. By working with heat stress researchers, we estimated his core body temperature rose by 3¬∞F, putting extreme stress on his heart. 

After demonstrating the danger of heat stress for people‚Äôs lives and bodies, we analyzed exclusive data from Harvard researchers to produce visualizations of what a typical year will look like in 12 global cities by 2100 under three different emissions scenarios. The data was analyzed using R and we produced the charts using ggplot2 and Adobe Illustrator.","Using sensors to collect all of these different datasets reliably is a challenge. It‚Äôs even harder when you need to rapidly move from one location to another as your subject goes about their day. We had to experiment with a number of different sensor setups to find the right technology, and, crucially, workflow that would work on the ground in Kuwait City and Basra. 

Due to the project‚Äôs focus on Basra, Iraq as one of the two locations, we also had to contend with strict export restrictions which prohibited the use of certain sensors, such as high resolution thermal imaging cameras. After weeks of research, we concluded that perfect thermal imaging product didn‚Äôt exist for this project, so one of our graphics editors sourced an appropriate thermal imaging sensor and soldered it onto a circuit board himself.","Sensor journalism offers data and visual journalists the opportunity to create their own datasets, rather than relying on datasets from governments or scientists. 

One of the main benefits to capturing your own data is that it allows your stories to have a much closer connection between the data visualizations and the on-the-ground reporting. Instead of showing city-level trends using available weather data, we were able to quantitatively show readers the conditions inside the home of the subjects we were reporting on and capturing video of. It allowed us to not just describe but visualize how the second-by-second temperatures in the room were dangerous for the people we were following.

Capturing your own data also allows you to find hyperlocal differences that aren‚Äôt visible in any existing datasets. We learned just how localized weather conditions can be. We are used to seeing weather conditions represent the temperature in a city as a single number, but we found that two streets just a mile apart could have significantly different temperature and humidity readings because of differences in air flow, nearby waterways and the different buildings on the street.

United Kingdom,Unearthed,Small,Shortlist,,Big oil's dirty secret in Iraq,29/09/2022,"Investigation, Long-form, Satellite images","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Unearthed combed through data on Iraq‚Äôs oil industry to reveal how its emissions vastly exceeded those that Big Oil acknowledges. At the same time, BBC journalists worked on the ground to tell the story of how the lives and health of ordinary Iraqis have been affected by flaring.

BP claims to be reducing emissions from flaring. But analysis of BP‚Äôs figures and independent satellite data showed that BP‚Äôs official emissions figures do not include those from a vast field in Iraq. If it did count its Iraq field, Unearthed found that BPs flaring emissions would be doubled.","Oil companies activities are under more scrutiny than ever before, but the way firms report their emissions lacks transparency and gives a misleading view to the public and to investors. 

Our reporting raised awareness of oil companies hiding the true scale of their emissions from investors and the public by not counting emissions from assets they do not operate on a day-to-day level. We found that if BP included its share of flaring emissions from its field in Iraq, its overall flaring emissions would be doubled. 

The reporting - shown in an hour-long BBC News Arabic documentary called 'Under Poisoned Skies' (Producer Owen Pinnell and Director Jess Kelly) that featured Unearthed's reporting and our longread article - offered an unprecedented insight into the public health problems caused by rampant gas flaring. 

The story led Iraq‚Äôs environment minister to acknowledge, for the first time, that there is a link between the high number of cancer cases in southern Iraq and out-of-control gas flaring. This had previously been denied by the government. 

BP, in response to the story, promised to ‚Äúwork with partners on any necessary interventions‚Äù.

As a result of the reporting by Unearthed and BBC News Arabic, teams of lawyers are exploring litigation against BP over the public health damage of gas flaring in southern Iraq.","We had to adopt a variety of approaches to reveal the scale and impact of Big Oil‚Äôs operations in Iraq, and to measure how this compared to the companies‚Äô publicly stated positions. 

Unearthed used open-source satellite imagery to map flare stacks and show that oil producers in Iraq were less than 10km from people‚Äôs homes, in breach of Iraqi law. 

We analysed company emissions data from BP and Italian firm Eni and identified gaps in both companies reporting by pairing this information with publicly available emissions tracking data, sourced from proprietary databases. This process enabled us to spot that BP and Eni were not counting emissions from flaring in Iraq in their annual emissions figures. 

Unearthed, together with scientists from the Greenpeace science unit, advised on on-the-ground pollution monitoring in southern Iraq, which, for the first time, gave an insight into the public health impact of rampant gas flaring on the people of southern Iraq.","The oil industry is not transparent in how it discloses its emissions, and working on a data-led story on this sector was a challenge. We had to painstakingly piece together emissions data from proprietary databases and then combine that with partial company emissions data disclosed in annual reports. 

Ensuring that the data was properly reported required detailed consultation with experts and industry insiders, in addition to those quoted in the piece. 

Added to that, through our work alongside BBC News Arabic we were working with teams of journalists based in Iraq, who had to deal with an array of security challenges both for themselves and for sources on the ground.","This is an example of how to combine rigorous data journalism with powerful on-the-ground reporting. 

It shows the real-world impact of fossil fuels and climate change, a topic that can often feel removed from people‚Äôs everyday lives. 

We hope journalists use this story as a jumping-off point to further interrogate Big Oil‚Äôs emissions figures and find other parts of the world where companies are making millions from fossil fuels, while not taking responsibility for the climate and public health damage stemming from their activities. 

We also hope the piece demonstrates the value of combining a huge range of innovative approaches - going beyond corporate disclosures and public data to include on-the-ground pollution monitoring, and satellite data - to provide a robust evidentiary baseline supporting powerful first-person testimony.",English,https://projects.unearthed.greenpeace.org/big-oil-iraq/,,,,,,,"Joe Sandler Clarke, Gurman Bhatia, Aidan Farrow, Owen Pinnell","**Joe Sandler Clarke**

- There has been a spike in these types of killings over the past few years, but the rate of occurrence has remained relatively flat since the mid-2000s. 
 
- Public mass shootings are only part of the story. 
 
- Victims of mass killings are more likely to have been killed by someone they know. 
 
- Most mass killings are committed using handguns. 
 
- Most mass killers are men. 
 
- Mass killings aren't confined to big cities.

The project has also been named ‚ÄúBest community service project/reporting‚Äù and runner-up for ‚ÄúBest use of data/infographics‚Äù by Editor and Publisher. It was also on the Data Visualization Society's Information Is Beautiful longlist. Deeper analysis of the database including visual stories, additional data visualizations and a breaking news response kit are planned for 2023.","The database is constructed and maintained using sound social science methodology, including a detailed codebook with explicit instructions on data collection protocols (this hyperlink is to a summary codebook, the full codebook is included at the end of this document.) In addition, determinations pertaining to certain subjective variables (e.g., underlying circumstances and motivation) involve judgements of multiple coders with any disagreements settled through consensus. Also, we avoid promoting data that depend on unreliable sources (e.g., reports by family and friends about mental health issues) that weaken other datasets.

The full database currently consists of four linked data tables with a total of 59 data fields (not counting indicators for the availability of offender/victim identity)‚Äî18 fields for each incident, 20 fields for each offender, 13 fields for each victim killed, and 8 fields for each weapon used. Most variables, with the notable exception of victim names, are available for public download. The remaining data are reserved for individuals affiliated with the Associated Press, USA TODAY/Gannett, and Northeastern University‚Äôs School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and others by permission of all three organizations. Moving forward, additional variables may be added to the full database as well as the public subset. 

The presenation is coded and designed in an elegant and resilant manner that should stand the test of time, and inevitable platform and technology shifts. Updates run automatically, the vizualiztions are responsive, and the project will be easy for some future graphics journalist to maintain and improve if they should discover it long after we are no longer working at USA TODAY.","This project is over a decade in the making and work on the most recent iteration of the database and presentation took longer than a year to complete. 
The effort started nearly a decade ago at USA TODAY when Paul Overberg, Meghan Hoyer, Mark Hannan, Jodi Upton, Barbie Hansen, and Erin Durkin contributed to an original 2012 data reporting effort. In 2016, primary data collection and verification efforts shifted from USA TODAY to Northeastern University. Northeastern researchers conducted extensive searches for incidents not reported in the SHR during the time period, utilizing internet search engines including Lexis-Nexis, Google News, and Newspapers.com. Northeastern University researchers also independently verified data collected by USA TODAY staff and filled in missing information, sometimes involving updated reports on older cases. 
 
In December 2018, a Memo of Understanding (MOU) was signed by The Associated Press, USA TODAY and Northeastern University to formalize a joint initiative to maintain and expand the mass killing database previously housed at USA TODAY. The Associated Press hosts the database and maintains the data entry tool; USA TODAY has developed and maintains the public website containing visualizations and interpretations of the data; and Northeastern University manages data collection and updates. At USA TODAY, the torch was passed from Jodi Upton and Meghan Hoyer to John Kelly, and subsequently Shawn Sullivan and Mitchell Thorson who remained committed to a complete overhaul of the project. It published in August 2022.

Researchers at USA TODAY first identified potential incidents using the FBI‚Äôs Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Homicide incidents in the SHR were flagged as potential mass murder cases if four or more victims were reported on the same record, and the type of homicide was coded as ‚Äúmurder or non-negligent manslaughter.‚Äù Cases were subsequently verified utilizing media accounts, court documents, academic journal articles, books, and local law enforcement records obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. 
 
Each data point was corroborated by multiple sources, which were compiled into a single document to assess the quality of information. When sources were contradictory, official law enforcement or court records were used, when available, followed by the most recent media or academic source. Case information was subsequently compared with other available mass murder or mass shooting databases to ensure validity. Incidents listed in the SHR that could not be independently verified were excluded from the database (many SHR records, contrary to the protocol, include injured victims along with those who were killed, giving the false impression of a mass killing). 
 
Finally, as an important step in checking for completeness, cases in our database are compared side-by-side against other available datasets (e.g., the Gun Violence Archive, Everytown for Gun Safety, The Violence Project, Mother Jones), finding no qualifying cases in other databases that are missing from our database but many in our database that are missing in others.","In short, the value of taking your time to get something right, willingness to collaborate across organizations, and honoring commitments.

Given the surging interest in mass killings, including those incidents that involve a firearm, as well as the lack of an official, government database on such cases, several news organization, academic collectives, and advocacy groups have launched their own database projects. In terms of the breadth of cases and range of variables, the USA TODAY/AP/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database is the most comprehensive, including incidents with four or victims killed regardless of location, motivation, victim-offender relationship, or weapon since 2006. Unlike other databases on the topic, tallies of injuries are not conflated with data on victims who are killed. Similarly, data on assailants who are killed at the scene or take their own lives are not blended with those on victim fatalities. 
 
There are several other features that make our database unique and of significant value to journalists, social scientists, and policy makers alike: 
 
It is the only relational database linking incident, offender, victim, and weapon characteristics‚Äîspanning more than five dozen data fields. 
 
It is the only database that includes the 20 percent of mass killings that are committed with means other than guns, recognizing that these victims are just as dead as those who are fatally shot and often suffer especially painful deaths. 
 
It is the only database that follows a case through the criminal justice process and eventual sentencing. 
 
It is the only database that features an interactive, visual website that is updated daily with the ability for others easily to download incident, offender, victim, and weapon data files.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2022/08/18/mass-killings-database-us-events-since-2006/9705311002/,https://data.world/associatedpress/mass-killings-public,https://query.data.world/s/mrodwdqxrjtz6fakei5c2stdvpljld,https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/08/how-the-ap-usa-today-and-northeastern-built-a-database-of-mass-killings-that-tracks-more-than-shootings/,https://news.northeastern.edu/2022/11/22/eppy-awards-mass-killings-database/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2022/11/23/chesapeake-walmart-shooting-mass-killings-database/10762179002/,,"Core team members from USA TODAY include: Mitchell Thorson, Karina Zaiets, George Petras, Veronica Bravo, and Shawn Sullivan.

Insider‚Äôs reporting has already spurred the newly elected Mobile County District Attorney in Alabama to commit to reopening one cold investigation, and pushed LA County prosecutors to file manslaughter charges in a case that had languished for a year after a suspect was identified.","We relied on sources including the Human Rights Campaign, Remembering Our Dead, the National Center for Trans Equality, and Out.com, as well as social media posts and searches of local news coverage through Google and Nexis to come up with a list of potential homicides. After submitting public records requests for all of these potential cases and reaching out to all the law enforcement agencies involved, we ultimately corroborated 175 transgender homicides over a 5-year period. We depended heavily on PACER, Westlaw, and dozens and dozens of county court websites in seeking out court records related to the cases where suspects were indicted. We used DocumentCloud to share some of our documents with the public.

We also hand-built a database from the documents we obtained from police, prosecutors, and courts, and supplemented by press reports and source interviews. The biggest difficulty with the data was making sure we were consistent during the hand coding process. We constructed a methodology for what our reporters needed to look out for while going through the documents we collected, and continued to iterate those categories as documents came in. For instance, we accounted for whether the case involved intimate partner violence, or if law enforcement was involved in the death; we tracked the demographics of each victim and suspect. Our team worked together to make sure we were as thorough and accurate as possible while building the database.

Based on that working document, we created a separate spreadsheet from which we pulled our data findings, with a glossary defining how to code each cell. Reporters then hand input the data into that new sheet, with dedicated cells for sourcing notes, and a team of fact-checkers verified our entries cell by cell.","Amid a spike in anti-trans legislation and hate speech, Insider's investigations team set out to explore anti-trans violence, gathering information on homicides targeting transgender and gender nonconforming, nonbinary, and two-spirit people from 2017 through 2021 across the United States and Puerto Rico.

Identifying each case was difficult, since the FBI does not track crimes by gender identity. Over the course of 13 months, a team of editors, reporters, and researchers attempted to fill in the gaps. We compiled a list of potential homicides of transgender and gender nonconforming people, then sent public record requests to police and prosecutors in every case, in addition to compiling court records. We ultimately documented 175 transgender homicide victims over a 5-year period ‚Äî almost certainly an undercount. As we read through the documents and pulled preliminary findings, we began to map out our package, taking note of clusters of intimate partner killings, killings of sex workers, killings by law enforcement, and killings driven by transphobia. As we tracked the outcome of each case, we developed stories that would examine unsolved killings and prosecutorial failures.

In many instances, law enforcement officials refused to hand over their homicide investigation files. In several cases, records were released only after Insider threatened to sue the investigating agency for violating state public records laws. Our reporters supplemented these records with conversations with friends, family, witnesses, jurors, judges, attorneys, law enforcement officials, and advocates to determine what happened. 

The resulting reporting is the most comprehensive accounting of transgender homicides ever assembled. Insider‚Äôs findings are shocking: Between 2019 and 2021, as political attacks on the transgender community escalated, transgender homicides doubled. We found that most of the victims were Black women, while most of the killers were young men in their teens and 20s. We found a striking failure of accountability ‚Äî only 16% of cases led to murder convictions, and only one killing over five years resulted in a hate-crimes conviction. Another 61 cases ‚Äî mostly involving Black transgender victims ‚Äî remain unsolved to this day. 

We found that nearly two-thirds of those killed were misgendered or misnamed by law enforcement in the records we reviewed. This not only showed disrespect to the dead, we found, but, Insider found, disrupted investigations and impacted outcomes in court.

We sent reporters across the country, who dug into cases from Alabama to Washington State, on law enforcement killings, hate crimes, intimate partner violence, the vulnerabilities of sex workers, unsolved cases, prosecutorial missteps, the troubled history of police and the transgender community, and the lethal attack on Club Q, stories that collectively expose the myriad ways that transgender people are at higher risk of violent crime, and face an uphill battle in receiving justice in the courts.","No news outlet has made a comprehensive effort to obtain primary documents to determine the demographics of victims and suspects in transgender homicides, the circumstances surrounding the killings, and the outcomes of the cases. Nor has any news outlet created a body of work deeply investigating more than a dozen of these homicides to expose in vivid detail how this nation‚Äôs legal system has failed transgender people.

There is also no federal agency that tracks homicides against transgender and gender nonconforming people, so we had to compile our 175 cases by hand, using disparate sources and incomplete and sometimes inaccurate press reports. 

We submitted public records requests to police and prosecutors in every case, but were frequently stymied by uncooperative agencies. We spent months cajoling custodians and clerks, visiting courthouses around the country in person, and handing over thousands of dollars to secure documents. In several cases, records were released only after Insider‚Äôs attorneys threatened to sue the investigating agency for violating state public records laws. We are still pursuing legal action to obtain several key records, post-publication. When our record requests were unsuccessful, we worked with family members who submitted those requests on our behalf as next of kin, or sought out prosecutors and law enforcement officials who might share documents with us directly.

As with most trauma-related reporting, we knew we had to take special care with our human sources, many of whom were still grieving their loved ones. The team completed trainings on trauma-informed reporting, and spent many months working with sources to make sure they understood the scope of the project and the questions we wanted to answer before asking them to sit down for interviews.",English,https://www.insider.com/transgender-violence-deaths-database-murder-cases-2017-2021,https://www.insider.com/transgender-hate-crimes-homicides-transphobia-insider-investigation-2022-11,https://www.insider.com/police-deaths-transgender-people-officer-killings-mental-health-crisis-2022-11,https://www.insider.com/transgender-sex-work-discrimination-violence-2022-12,https://www.insider.com/police-failed-to-solve-a-third-of-killings-targeting-transgender-people-2022-12,https://www.insider.com/killings-of-transgender-people-transphobia-in-the-criminal-justice-system-2022-12,,"Project Members:

Nigeria,West Africa Weekly,Small,Shortlist,,"Suicide, Fraud and Phillips Consulting: The Story Of West Africa's Chinese Loan Shark Mafia",30/05/2022,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Crime","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","In the light of the growth of illegal app-based loan sharking operations in Nigeria and West Africa, this story investigated the origins of these loan sharks and for the first time ever, revealed the personal and corporate identities of the key people and organisations involved in data theft, harassment, blackmail and financial fraud inherent in these operations.

Specifically, Soko Lending Company - a Chinese parent entity of several such loan app brands - was identified and tied to a physical location, as was Phillips Outsourcing, an otherwise respectable corporate consulting firm which was revealed to be an active collaborator.","Following my story which was published on May 30, Nigeria's National Data Protection Bureau (NDPB) announced on August 15 that it was carrying out an investigation into the activities of Phillips Outsourcing and an unnamed Nigerian Bank suspected of aiding online loan sharks.

Shortly after my story was published, Soko Lending Company was forced to abandon its newly acquired office space and go dark in the light of intense public scrutiny. It also scrubbed all its presence off social media, deactivating its Twitter and Facebook accounts. 

In the week after the story was published, Ken who was mentioned at the outset, suddenly woke up to find his loan balance with Sokoloan mysteriously cleared, following months of harassment and defamation which had persisted up until that point.","In verifying the information provided by the whistleblowers, I made extensive use of the semi-public Nigerian Inter Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) database, which contains the Bank Verification Number (BVN) details of all corporate and individual Nigerian bank customers.

By design or by accident, it is the case that when making an account to account transfer in Nigeria, one is able to pull up the name on an account by entering the account number into the bank app. This meant that using this functionality, which pulls data from the central NIBSS database, it was possible to independently verify the account details provided by the whistleblowers and thus produce solid evidence of a financial relationship between the illegal loan shark and Phillips Outsourcing.

This use of technology also provided empirical evidence that despite it being clearly against the law and regardless of prior denials by the banks involved, illegal online loan sharks also had access to formal banking services in Nigeria.

I also made extensive use of photo editing software to manually redact the sensitive financial information contained in the data samples and screen captures that I published, which were taken from the loan shark's leaked internal customer data dump. This way, I was able to prove that Soko Lending Company was guilty of severe data privacy and data protection violations without exposing the affected customers to increased risk.","The major constraint that made this story so challenging to work on was the sheer amount of time involved in cultivating sources and whistleblowers. I began working on this story back in July 2021, and it was not until April 2022 that I finally got my biggest breakthrough with a whistleblower. https://twitter.com/DavidHundeyin/status/1420316734913974272?t=20I_7uQKhj0X2_dHGgoQqQ&s=19

The reason for the long delay was the trust gap that exists between the Nigerian media and Nigerian audiences, who believe Nigerian journalists to be corrupt, compromised or mediocre. Only after sufficiently differentiating myself from the perceived mainstream with my work over the intervening 8 months did the most important whistleblowers begin to trust me enough to reach out with the key information.","The major takeaway for other journalists working under similar circumstances is to do away with the expectation that investigative projects will necessarily produce the type and scope of results they generally expect. For example I certainly did not expect a respected mainstream corporate consultancy brand like Phillips Outsourcing to show up anywhere in this story, much less end up at the very centre of it, resulting in an unprecedented federal investigation, but that is exactly what happened.

After a few months of research and hunting for information, it might have been easier to accept defeat and turn in a significantly less impactful story centred on the human angle side of things. The problem is that such a story - focusing on the impact of the illegal actions of loan sharks on their victims - had already been done multiple times before, and would have resulted in little more than empty sympathy. Keeping the hook in the water until something that significantly progressed or elevated the conversation came up turned out to be the correct decision.",English,https://westafricaweekly.substack.com/p/suicide-fraud-and-phillips-consulting,https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2022/08/15/phillips-consulting-bank-under-probe-over-violation-of-data-regulations/,https://twitter.com/davidhundeyin/status/1531189793908047874,https://twitter.com/DavidHundeyin/status/1420316734913974272?t=20I_7uQKhj0X2_dHGgoQqQ&s=19,,,,David Hundeyin,"David is a writer, investigative journalist and broadcaster whose work has appeared on CNN, The Africa Report, Al Jazeera and The Washington Post.

United States,USA TODAY,Big,Shortlist,,Broken Adoptions,19/05/2022,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Infographics","Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R, RStudio","Broken Adoptions revealed how and why adoptions fail, creating anguish for everyone involved. It tapped a massive federal database of foster children to quantify the problem and identify, using statistical regression, key risk factors for failure. The project highlighted how states have been allowed to supply bad data that undermines any effort to judge the efficacy of $3 billion a year in federal adoption subsidies.","This project exposed breakdowns at every point in the adoption process. Many parents wait years for children who never arrive thanks to failures by adoption agencies. Social workers and agencies lie about children‚Äôs backgrounds to move their adoptions along faster. And, when something goes wrong, a common pattern emerges: Parents, prospective parents and the children often find themselves without support or recourse.

The project produced the first (and highly conservative) estimate of failed adoptions in America. It also identified major shortcomings in the collection of data on children returned to foster care from failed adoptions, pointing the way toward potential reforms. 

There was an overwhelming response from readers. The series was one of the top subscription-drivers for USA TODAY all year, and subscriber pageviews also ranked highly. Each installment of Broken Adoptions was followed by an outpouring of appreciation, from social workers and policymakers, parents and adoptees around the country. Some became sources for the ongoing work. Others just wanted to thank the reporters for uncovering such a hidden tragedy and making them feel seen.

The series also set the stage for data reporters at other organizations to plumb the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System for accountability stories no one has yet told. AFCARS can tell how long a child remains in foster care, how many are diverted for years to group homes state-by-state, and how these outcomes vary by race, ethnicity, gender and age of the child.","We learned early on that no one had quantified how many U.S. adoptions fail. Building on work of previous USA TODAY reporters, Aleszu Bajak scoured the obscure Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, or AFCARS. The multi-million-record database shows the status of each child in foster care each year, including whether a child was previously adopted. Although unique identifiers are meant to link records across years, Bajak found states inconsistent about flagging a kid‚Äôs past adoption and preserving IDs. Any responsible estimate required painstakingly weeding out nonsensical cases, such as those that went from ‚ÄúAdopted‚Äù to ‚ÄúNever adopted‚Äù in one year.

Tallying up 66,000 failed adoptions was only the start, however. Bajak wanted to know why they failed. The breakthrough came when he unearthed a study finding 16 states with reliable IDs in AFCARS over time. Suddenly, we could track trips from foster care to adoption and back with confidence. Bajak decided to see what happened to a cohort adopted from 2008 to 2010. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, Bajak found statistically significant, independent risk factors predicting failure. The results might help child welfare workers know which kids need the most support at the time of adoption placement. Yet no one had done this analysis to tell them.

The reporting begged one last question. Why did states so frequently delete child identifiers from AFCARS, seemingly breaking from guidance laid down for this federally funded database? It was one of those irritating data flaws that, in this case, had newsworthy consequences. Bajak tracked down the bureaucrat who designed AFCARS three decades ago, and she had a lot to say. Through this and other historical research, Bajak showed how a deliberately obfuscated dataset undermines our ability to see whether billions in adoption subsidies are working.","The federal data underlying this series included records of 3.4 million children who spent time in foster care from 2008 to 2020, culled from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System. It was complex and dirty, requiring months of effort to wrangle down. 

The database was enormous, requiring us to first pare down pieces we needed using Google Big Query. Although extensive guidance exists for states to follow when submitting data, our quality checks (and numerous federal audits) showed their submissions often go awry. All children entering foster care are supposed to be flagged if they‚Äôve been through a prior adoption, but reporters detected many erroneous flags and had to painstakingly weed them out. Washington officials acknowledged and promised to fix a major flaw in their reporting system that we brought to their attention.

Using and describing the results of a Cox proportional hazards regression was also an enormous challenge. Aleszu Bajak learned from his research that this method was appropriate for our longitudinal dataset, but he wanted to be confident he did it right. For this, he consulted closely and repeatdly with an array of statisticians who understand the technique. 

To present the data in an accessible way, we worked with USA TODAY's Storytelling Studio to create ""scrollytelling"" animations that wove together dataviz and illustrations in narrative form. These scrollies were built using Adobe Illustrator, After Effects and Svelte.

In story form, the reporters breathed life into their data and findings by telling deeply personal narratives of adoptive parents and adoptees themselves. Those stories came through extensive efforts to seek out those affected, including creating an online questionnaire for adoptees, adoptive parents and officials and mailing postcards to thousands of adoption center clients with a Q/R code thatlinked to a survey. 

Building trust took time and determination as did unearthing records to bolster ‚Äì or sometimes debunk ‚Äì shaky memories of childhood and trauma.

One article recounted the tragedy of a family adopting out of foster care who could not get government approval for the mental health care their daughter needed. Before her adoption became final, 11-year-old Becca took her own life.

Another looked back at a California-based adoption agency that went bankrupt, leaving hundreds of families in the lurch. The investigation found the Independent Adoption Center‚Äôs leadership knew what was coming but continued to enroll new clients up to the week it closed itsdoors. California state officials knew, too, but their investigation went nowhere.

The final installment traveled home to Africa with Charles, whose American adoptive mother discovered she had been misled: His biological mother had not agreed to give him up and hewas four years older than his records indicated. The State Department and the adoption agency offered no help.

Because reliable resources are hard for adoptive parents to come by, USA TODAY published links to nonprofit advocacy groups that specialize in this field as well as testimonials from adult adoptees who have drawn lessons from their own broken adoptions to help others fare better.","Understanding the shortcomings of your data is essential. Get to know the people who built a database, the user manuals for people who submit data to it, the academic experts who use it for research and the process that its owners use to test it for errors. We made all of these contacts, and it ensured we were on solid ground.

Seek out a second set of eyes for your analysis, if you can. We ran all of our regressions by experts in pure statistics, not just people who study this particular type of data. We also had a second data reporter internally review the R analytical code for potential flaws.

Since February 24, 2022, there has not been a single day in our country when the Russians did not bombard Ukrainian territory with rocket, air, or artillery strikes. On the map, you can sort the shellings by type and by dates or specific time periods. In some cases, we provide satellite images, right by clicking a rectangle on the map. The dataset is our own, gathered since February 24 from news in media.","Missile, aviation, artillery. Since February 24, Ukraine has not had a single calm day - Russians are come with various types of shelling of Ukrainian territory every day. How many of them, these different types of shelling, and how were they distributed over the territory of Ukraine during this time?

To find out, we created a data journalism project with an interactive map. The map shows the shelling by date and area, and satellite images y click.

This project gives a general overview and does not aim to show absolute accuracy since some instances of shelling were not mentioned in the news we processed. Our database was created on February 24, 2022 and constantly updating.","The project is based on the information about Russian shelling in Ukraine shared in the news. In the first days, there were several sources of information such as the leading news sites, including the local media. However, the information in there was always duplicated, so in a few weeks‚Äô time, we decided to continue monitoring only www.pravda.com.ua/news. Some data also came from verified eyewitness reports (i.e. friends and relatives). 

As for the data extracted from the news items, the algorithm was as follows: we listed the names of all settlements that were shelled. We then checked them all against the corresponding date on the fire map. If we saw a fire that day, we indicated its coordinates in the table and marked the entry as accurate. In most instances, fires recorded on NASA satellite maps corresponded with the locations of shelling.

All the strikes are divided into three groups: rocket strikes (along with the air launches), air strikes (projectiles and bombs dropped from aircraft, helicopters and drones), as well as artillery (either barrel or rocket), mortar and tank strikes.

As a source for satelite images we used Planet.com which kindly provided us access to their database.","We aware that there are other maps on the web, shows shelling of Ukrainian territory, but as far as we know any of them is considered as official. Our work to gather data started on Febuary 24 and still continues. Based on this dataset we also developed other projects, as well are open to share the dataset with researches.","We started collecting data for this map on 24 February when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At that time, we focused on comparing the cities that have been mentioned in the news after being hit by the Russian missiles with the map of fires to determine the locations and the extent of the damage.

It renewed calls for greater transparency and accountability of Australia‚Äôs federal political donations laws and gave impetus to the introduction of two separate bills for political donations reform at the federal level.""","""At the heart of the project is our gambling payments database, which brings together, for the first time, the political donations registers for every state and territory. 

Our ‚Äúmaster dataset‚Äù combined and then expanded on datasets used in previous research. We uncovered dozens of new gambling entities by undertaking forensic examination of company records, annual reports, media archives, financial statements, etc. and consulting extensively with researchers, gambling reform groups, and other experts. 

Many of these individuals and organisations had been excluded from previous analyses because they own or operate other business or political interests alongside gambling ventures.

From here, we built our database by: 

1.Matching our gambling client list with 22 years of data and metadata scraped from the AEC Transparency Register. 
2.Combing through hundreds of PDF scans of original disclosure forms on the AEC website, manually collecting additional payment details missed or excluded from the online database. 
3.Matching the master list with records extracted from each of the seven state and territory political donations registers, some of which had to be collated by hand from PDFs.

It continues to identify and present news on a range of topics, including climate change, gender, and animal welfare.",Big,Shortlist,,The 500 records of Femicide,19/01/2022,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Quiz/game, Database, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Women, Human rights","Animation, Personalisation, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","These are the first articles to comprehensively analyze Femicide records in Korea. 
Among the 2,000 rulings sentenced between 2016 and 2021, 427 'meaningful' rulings that can be clearly classified as Femicide were selected .
We also found 73 cases more in which a man killed a woman and killed himself in media. 
There are no articles that have discussed 500 cases and vastly described over 600 pages for total on such a single topic. 
We won the 'Data Visualization Article of the Year 2022' at Korea Data Journalism Awards.","After the 2016 ""Gangnam Station Women's Murder Case,"" women continued to mourn and anger, saying, ""I survived because I was lucky."" Femicide, the most extreme violence against women, is increasingly known through individual cases, but there have been no reports that the gender-based violence is treated as a 'phenomenon' and 'structural problem'
'Hankyoreh21'(Weekly paper of Hankyoreh media)'s '500 Femicide Records' received meaningful reviews from administrative authorities, experts, and general readers. After the report, many people from various fields said thank you to us. I've heard a lot of people say, ""I saw the article well,"" but it's my first time hearing, ""Thank you for writing the article."" Especially, women's studies researchers, government officials, and civil society activists said, ""Reporters have done what we failed to do."" 
Why couldn't they do this in the meantime? It may be because the state has not been interested in the 'death' of women. After our report, several police officials who are set to reorganize the criminal justice system (called Kicks) in 2022. And officials who are considering gender violence have also said they got ""a lot of inspiration."" 
I was invited to a related discussion meeting and asked about the analyzed data. The National Police Agency is preparing to improve the system to correct criminal statistics regarding femicide. In itself, our reports have renewed social interest in the murdered women.
More than thousands of reactive web pages, which allow victims of domestic violence to experience the possibility of a ""safe breakup,"" have been shared on social media such as Twitter, drawing attention. Since then, whenever there have been murders of women, such as the Inha University sexual violence murder and the Sindang Station stalking murder, the Femicide report has been shared and highlighted through SNS.","We analyzed the 3,500-page rulings over 50 items (the type of relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the location of the murder, the area of the incident, the duration of the relationship, the main method of crime, the motive for the murder, the average sentence of the defendant, etc.)
Various statistics analyzed in this way were implemented with graphs and fact check system. Based on these results, interactive news was visualized using HTML, css, and javascript. We collaborated with illustration designers to create a separate web page where readers can record their experiences, and to break the conventional notion of ""why women who have experienced domestic violence can't escape from the perpetrators of violence,"" we expressed the seriousness of the problem online.
The SNS response on the web page (https://stop-femicide.hani.co.kr), which allows victims of domestic violence to experience the possibility of a ""safe breakup"" with the perpetrator, was also very hot. Tens of thousands of cases were shared on Twitter, and messages of sympathy poured out to the victims, regardless of gender.
On the special web page (http://speakup.hani.co.kr), titled ""Let me hear your surviving voice,"" hundreds of ordinary citizens wrote about their experiences with gender violence and femicide.
If you search on Facebook or Twitter with keywords such as 'femicide' and 'murdered women', you can easily find articles related to 'Hankyoreh 21's Femicide reports or web pages.","There are no statistics on women being killed in close relationships in Korea. Femicide is also a relatively underdeveloped topic in domestic academia. Even the police and the prosecution, which are investigative agencies, have been recording statistics on cases in old-fashioned way, so they have not even been able to figure out in what context women are killed by and how many women are killed by thier boyfriend, spouse or husband.
This is why we manually searched and found the ruling in the court library for more than a month. 
In order to ensure that our records do not end up with flat data trapped in the 'judgment sentence', we met with those who lost their mothers or daughters to femicide crimes, and listened to women who survived from their own threats to death. 
From January 2016 to November 2021, media reports (including news agencies) combined words such as ""lover, girlfriend, woman, dating, wife, couple, murder, suicide, extreme choice, abandonment, police"" to find 73 cases in which a man killed a woman and killed himself. 
And also we consulted with domestic and foreign experts, activists, and investigative agency officials who were thinking about how to prevent violence against women, and received professional manuscripts for articles.","When the murder of a woman was dealt with in Korea, it was often provocative and sensational like yellow journalism. A woman's tragedy was also used only as a tool to increase the number of views. When looking at the forest without just looking at the trees, I think we can find the structural causes of repeated killings of women and come up with various measures to decrease this kind of murder. We hope that there will be a lot of this type of article about crimes against minorities.
Also, I think it is meaningful to use various devices to capture the voices of women directly who have experienced gender-based violence as much as possible. I think it's an example of how an article can interact with society.
The report complied with the Code of Media Ethics. While revealing the horrors of crime in the reporting process, we thought deeply about journalistic ethics on how not to end up with sensational criminal reporting. I think we have also achieved results in proving the truth with data and urging attention through storytelling, toward a society that ignores the clear reality of violence against women, distorts, and encourages debate. In that sense, we are confident that we have created a norm for crime reporting that is useful at any time beyond the theme of Femicide.",Korean,https://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/COLUMN/2757/,http://stop-femicide.hani.co.kr/,https://speakup.hani.co.kr/,,,,,"Park, DaHae (doall@hani.co.kr)

The story reveals how the complex ownership of companies that are partly state-owned involve US investment funds, that at the same time have shares in their rival US military companies. It‚Äôs a fully data-driven project about one of the most important topics at the moment ‚Äì defence. Data has been leading us and we were following the money and looking into ownership of dozens of companies involved.","One of the strengths of this investigation is the fact it was at the same time a cross-border story and individual, it is not possible to divide it in pieces, not by country, neither by players. It is a puzzle that makes sense only when all the pieces are together and only then reveals for the first time how EU money for military development has been spent and how those companies are co-owned by EU governments and US investment funds that are at the same time shareholders of their rival US arms companies. 
This story offered to the citizens true about how their money is being spent for so called military development. The supposed anti-corruption mechanism weren‚Äôt really applied and digging deeper into projects has shown how fair competence wasn‚Äôt assured and ‚Äúthe European military industry is like a Russian doll‚Äù where companies own companies that own companies.
The story was originally published by the European media outlet Investigate Europe and its partners infoLibre in Spain and Publico in Portugal. Besides that, story was republished in various media outlets in different countries, such as in Poland (https://frontstory.pl/wojsko-unia-europejska-ue-arma-nato-rosja/), Hungary (https://telex.hu/komplex/2022/03/29/nobel-bekedijtol-a-fegyverexportig-az-eu-militarizacioja), Italy (https://valori.it/industria-militare-europea-fondi-usa/).","OSINT ‚Äì this is how we started, by researching all available information about the topic we were looking into and identified where the data we need lays. And it was not just for the data, using OSINT technique led us to a lot of findings and information that we needed to build the story, to put the data in context, to identify all the problematic dots in the big EU defence development projects.

Scraping with RStudio ‚Äì once the data has been identified, some of it was suitable for scraping, so we collected one part of the data by scraping it with R programming language.

Collecting data from all possible sources ‚Äì for the data that we didn‚Äôt feel secure to scrape, to avoid any possible mistakes, we were collecting it manually. We were building excel databases from carefully collected data from the reliable sources on the web. 

Data analysis in RStudio which has led to conclusions that actually made the story ‚Äì by using the R programming language, we were able to clean data, to analyse it and to make draft visualizations to see what it actually shows.

We used Flourish for data visualizations in our story, choosing carefully the best ways to present different kinds of data ‚Äì the graphs were talking themselves, but we needed explanations and comments from the experts from the field.

Interviewing experts ‚Äì we were looking for different kinds of experts to analyse and comment on our findings, including experts for competition, for complex ownership structures, for finances and the ones that should be taking care actually of the whole thing described.","In the sense of political context, just a month before this story was published, Russia attacked Ukraine and the war in Europe has started. Military issue has become topic more important than ever. And still, so many holes haven‚Äôt been reported. Instead of reporting only on single deals or exports, we wanted to catch the full scope, to measure this arms business in its full size and to clearly identify who has been profiting from money intended for military development of Europe. Identifying the concrete players, companies that won the biggest share of the fund allocated, actually led to discovering the whole network that has been profiting by securing most of the money for these military development projects in the EU. 

And data was there. It was all around, on the EU websites, on companies websites, on websites with market data. The crucial was to pull all that data and to analyse it piece by piece. And once we have put all those pieces together, we got the puzzle that revealed the network of the biggest players in arms market. 

Innovative technologies that we applied while working on this story were scraping data at the very beginning, and present it in the modern way using the most suitable data visualization form that Flourish has developed for so many different ways to present the data in the best possible shape.","First thing ‚Äì power of data is unimaginable in any area that can cross your mind.

Secondly -- keep digging as far as possible.

Third but crucial part ‚Äì when team is good, teamwork is priceless. Combining different skills of three journalists was really powerful and inspirative because at every stage, one of us could see a step forward and that‚Äôs why we came to the story much deeper and way further than we planned at the beginning and than we actually expected. 

Questioning each other in different stages was empowering the story itself, by brainstorming and factchecking during the work process. Although we are all journalists with financial expertise, all of us came with some kind of different skills, and combining data skills, financial skills, identifying right things and finding reputable professional people to interview, it all lead to this story which we have built from the root and by going further every time showed us the real story that had to be revealed and told.","English, Spanish, Portuguese",https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/money-for-eu-defence-development-went-to-a-small-group-of-arms-producers/,https://www.infolibre.es/politica/pequeno-grupo-empresas-beneficia-mayor-parte-dinero-ue-destina-defensa_1_1223737.html,https://www.publico.pt/2022/03/27/mundo/noticia/militar-ue-medese-euros-tropas-2000085,,,,,"Ana Curic, Paulo Pena and Manuel Rico","Ana Curic is an investigative and data journalist based in Belgrade, Serbia.

His name has never appeared on any document and officials deny he owns anything.

But our investigation found a network of companies, holding assets worth $4.5+ billion, which appears to benefit Putin. These 86 companies, identified by reporters through their email domain, llcinvest.ru, hold all the major assets ever ascribed to him.

Many of these assets were supplied to the system by wealthy businessmen/the president‚Äôs friends, suggesting massive conflicts of interest. And it shows how, while not formally ‚Äúowning‚Äù anything, Putin and his inner circle benefit through this informal arrangement.","The project was published in over a dozen media outlets (see above) and reached a wide international audience in many languages, including Russian.

In the country, where political and press freedoms are suppressed, we rarely see any real results of journalistic investigations. In an interview, a spokesperson for Putin referred to our investigation as ‚Äústryapnya‚Äù (meaning something not tasty that you cook. This word is used to describe unfair reporting). However, no factual comments were ever made to explain the existence of LLCInvest group and Putin‚Äôs involvement in it.","Reporters obtained several leaked email archives and used them as a starting point to map out the network of LLCInvest companies holding Putin‚Äôs assets. We found that the llcinvest.com domain is hosted by an IT company called Moskomsvyaz that is linked to Bank Rossiya. Moskomsvyaz appears to be a kind of in-house provider of technology services for the Bank Rossiya universe. On examining the full range of IP addresses that includes LLCInvest.ru, reporters found dozens of other email domains representing other companies, which encompassed assets linked to Putin. 

Moscomsvyaz's IP range gave us the initial list of companies, some were familiar to us. Our hypothesis: all of them are parts of one group. We checked if directors and shareholders of these companies are using LLCInvest emails, we noticed that all LLCInvest addresses have the same pattern: the first letter of the name and the surname of the user. We used a web resource to check if an email exists and found dozens of existing addresses: Hunter.io, Email checker 

That gave us about 40 companies and we researched all available data about them, their subsidies, directors and shareholders. 

We used numerous official and commercial corporate databases:

National Tax Service, biggest commercial database Spark, https://companies.rbc.ru/, https://vbankcenter.ru/contragent) 


Final list of LLCIncest companies consisted of 100+ companies. We used many databases to find their purpose and assets, including

Official Land Registry
Official Russian registry of boats 
Ship Tracking and Plane tracking resources
Custom Records

Odnoklassniki 

OCCRP‚Äôs entity extraction and database tool, Aleph, was invaluable; we uploaded thousands of leaked emails and made them searchable. Aleph helped us cross-check these emails with other available datasets, such as custom, corporate, and land records. We used Google‚Äôs spreadsheet functionality to build a database of all companies making up the LLCInvest system.","This story is based on hundreds of corporate records and thousands of leaked emails. It was a complicated analysis of big data in an effort to establish the wealth of the president of Russia. It was hard to nail the story and to present all the facts in a way that a reader who is not familiar with complex corporate structures would understand. 

While working on a story one of the main reporters, Olesya Shmagun, was designated by the Russian authorities as a foreign agent, an label that many vocal critics of Putin received in the last two years. This makes it much more difficult to conduct journalistic work in Russia.

Russia‚Äôs brutal invasion of Ukraine started when reporting was finished and the piece was being edited. Very shortly after the invasion, the website of our Russian partner, Meduza, was blocked in Russia and OCCRP was proclaimed an undesirable organization. That made any cooperation with OCCRP illegal for any Russian citizen, including reporters, editors and even experts who provided comments for the story. 

Russian partner Meduza published the story even though open association with OCCRP put them at risk of criminal prosecution.","The biggest lesson is the amount of meticulous organization required. Such a project has so many different leaks, moving parts, and bits of information that it requires a systematic way of collecting and analyzing that information, otherwise it would be impossible to extract anything useful.

It‚Äôs also very important for investigative reporters to have an ongoing dialogue with their editors about how to interpret the data, how to shape the narrative, and how to make sure they‚Äôre extracting what would make the best story. This needs to be done throughout the reporting process, not just afterwards.

The complexity of this story required very careful storytelling to make sure the subject matter ‚Äî and especially the exact level of proof obtained by reporters ‚Äî is communicated to readers. We rewrote the story what seems like a dozen times until we were satisfied that we were conveying exactly what we found in a way that our readers can understand and learn from.

It is also important to be clear about which elements of the story are not fully understood. There is a lot of value in being clear and up-front, communicating what is known and what is not, rather than trying to cover it up. This ensures that other journalists will have opportunities to add to the story, and also that we are transparent about what we can prove and what we cannot.","Meduza (Russia, in Russian), Le Monde (France, in French), Der Spiegel (Germany, in German), Profil (Austria, in German), Investigace.cz (Czech Republic, in Czech), Siena.lt (Lithuania, in Lithuanian), Eesti Ekspress (Estonia, in Estonian), The Guardian (U.K., in English), Information.dk (Denmark, in Danish), FTM (The Netherlands, in Dutch), Infolibre (Spain, in Spanish), Tijd (Belgium, in Flemish), Tamedia (Switzerland, in German), Tamedia (Switzerland, in French), Dagbladet Information (Denmark, in Danish), NDR/WDR (Germany, in German), IRPI (Italy, in Italian), YLE (Finland, in Finnish) and Inside Story (Greece, in Greek)",https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/mysterious-group-of-companies-tied-to-bank-rossiya-unites-billions-of-dollars-in-assets-connected-to-vladimir-putin,https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/we-cannot-use-it-leaked-emails-show-how-russian-petrochemical-giant-sibur-paid-for-villa-linked-to-putin,https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/putins-dacha-on-lake-ladoga-is-growing-under-supervision-of-non-profit-linked-to-llcinvest,,,,,"Olesya Shmagun (OCCRP), Denis Dmitriev (Meduza), Miranda Patrucic (OCCRP), Ilya Lozovsky (OCCRP)","Olesya Shmagun has worked with OCCRP for the last seven years.

The investigation found that European vessels have exported more than half of all fossil fuel shipments from Russia since the start of the war. 

The project started as a data monitoring mechanism into how Greek shipping dominates seaborne transports from Russia. With the collaboration of Investigate Europe, it evolved into a cross-border investigation which revealed how this network of European ships continued to help provide profits to Moscow.","The investigation series resonated across borders. It revealed how European ships - and their high-profile owners - helped to fuel Moscow‚Äôs war machine by exporting fossil fuels after the invasion of Ukraine.

Combining in-depth data analysis, investigative reporting, unique visualizations, multimedia elements and traditional storytelling, the 9-months long investigation is presented in a diverse and creative way across several platforms.

Beyond Greece, the main findings were also published with nine media partners in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Russia and in 10 languages, offering not only a European perspective but also unique national narratives.

In Greece, the investigation prompted fiery parliamentary debates. It was used by a famous stand-up comedian in several of his gigs. It stands at the core of a big SLAPP lawsuit filed by one of the most active shipowners in the Russian fossil fuel transport against a member of the parliament.

The series attracted the interest of international media companies such as Japan‚Äôs Nikkei and Germany‚Äôs DW that traveled to Greece to follow up on the Greek reporters‚Äô leads. [DW made a video report for its ‚ÄúFocus On Europe‚Äù programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6RuDhWaWso) filming Greek reporters while they investigated in the waters south of Greece.

Other colleagues were inspired by our investigation. The head of investigations at a hub of African journalists reached out to us to ask for a potential collaboration in the expansion of the project to Africa. A Moroccan freelance journalist contacted us to request research support and our dataset.

After publication by our media partner in Portugal, Publico, Portugal‚Äôs Prime Minister was confronted with the findings by an opposition politician during a parliamentary session.

The series has also been highlighted and shared by notable organisations including the [Global Investigative Journalism Network](https://mailchi.mp/gijn/newsletter-oct12-2022) and Global Witness.","The starting point for our investigation was the [Russian Tanker Tracker](https://twitter.com/RUTankerTracker): A Twitter bot of oil and gas tankers leaving Russian ports, automated by Greenpeace. The bot retrieves and publishes shipping data (such as a ship's position, movement, name, IMO number and other unique identifiers) in real time from the online ship tracking service [Marine Traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/).

To download Greenpeace‚Äôs bot Twitter feed we used the online tool vicinitas.io. To retrieve details about the performance of each vessel and its managing companies, we scrapped [Equasis](https://www.equasis.org/). We did that by feeding the unique IMO number of each ship (extracted from Marine Traffic) to the search box of Equasis using selenium. 

With more reporters from different countries joining the team, with new editorial challenges and on-the-ground developments, and with our drive towards enriching and diversifying our sources, we needed to review and rebuild our methodology to meet the new circumstances that greet our investigation's long-term objectives. That‚Äôs why we decided to merge our data with data acquired data through [CREA‚Äôs API](https://energyandcleanair.org/). A valuable addition that came with this hybrid methodology was entries regarding coal transportations by bulk carrier and general cargo ships, previously not available in our analysis.

After collecting all the data, four different datasets were created:

* One with the bot's tweets.
* One with the position and course of ships as reported by Marine Traffic.
* One with ship ownership data as registered with Equasis.
* One with CREA‚Äôs tracking of ship movements.

Each dataset had to be cleaned and corrected in order to create our master dataset. This was done in Python (pandas) and OpenRefine.

For the publication of our graphics, we built a framework using d3. All graphics were translatable and customizable in a purpose-build backend built with Django REST-API and a frontend built using Vue and a UI framework (Vuetify).","Finding all the relevant data provided many levels of challenges, mainly due to a lack of transparency in the sector and the complexity of tracking a ship's movement in an automated way and in almost real time. In our hunt for data on European shipping firms we have used a wide range of techniques. In addition to scraping websites or extracting structured data from APIs, human handling was also required to eliminate duplicate records and to match the managing company of a vessel with the people behind it. 

The resulting ‚ÄúFuelling War‚Äù project is an ongoing cross-border and data-driven investigation of Investigate Europe and Reporters United with 8 media partners and contributions from more than 20 investigative reporters, data journalists and visualisation experts in 10 languages. It comes with a subheading that gets straight to the point: ‚ÄúHow European ships keep Russia‚Äôs economy afloat.‚Äù 

In fact, hyprocicy is the main issue of this project. We didn‚Äôt want to show how many millions of tonnes of fossil fuels European vessels have shipped from Russian ports since the invasion started without examining the bigger picture. Our team of ‚Äúnational‚Äù reporters confronted companies and shipowners, challenging their hypocrisy as most of them in their public stance condemned ‚ÄúRussian atrocities‚Äù while profiting from the war and enriching Putin‚Äôs regime. [The series exposed several high profile shipowners](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/shipping-tycoons-trading-with-russia/). Among them well-known owners of national media outlets, global art benefactors, football club owners and other public figures.

The focus of our stories was shaped by the data we used. This structure allowed us to combine on-the-ground reporting with exclusive data wrangling and visual storytelling in a compelling narrative across countries, platforms and formats. 

In Italy, the key was to look into the ports of arrival for bulk carriers and oil tankers. As a result, we were able to pinpoint specific locations on the map and send our Italian reporter to Sicily with his camera on hand to capture [the arrival of an oil tanker at the port of Milazzo](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/it/2022/sanzioni-ue-cosi-l-italia-ha-aumentato-l-import-di-greggio-milazzo/). Both the main article and visual reportage were also published by the Italian daily newspaper il Fatto Quotidiano. 

In Greece, we detected multiple ship-to-ship (STS) transfers ‚Äì where ships unload cargo onto another vessel at sea and switch off tracking systems to evade detection and country sanctions. Our Greek team travelled to the Laconian Gulf in the south-eastern Peloponnese, which has become an international hotspot for STS loading, to investigate those transfers. 

In Norway, our team look into the data to investigate [the issue of sanctions and the key role of the insurance industry in stopping oil exports from Russia](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/eu-sanctions-will-still-allow-half-of-european-insured-russian-oil-shipments/). They found that more than 20% of all fossil fuel shipments leaving Russia between 24 February to 31 August were covered by Norwegian insurers.

This contextualisation was highlighted by the shared visual language of all publications. The shared data visualizations by the Innovation Lab at Tagesspiegel allowed for each graphic to be translated and adapted to match the language and the look and feel of the publication medium.","We see this as a project about the ethical and ‚Äì with new sanctions, and EU bans on Russian fossil fuels in effect ‚Äì legal implications of topping up Putin‚Äôs war chest, despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine.

While there is no shortage of write-ups about Europe‚Äôs dependence on Russian fossil fuels, follow-ups on recent attempts to cut Moscow off of Europe‚Äôs energy budgets, and reports on sanctions against the Kremlin, our long-term cross-border investigation shines a light on the European shipping companies and operators that continue to export fossil fuels from Putin‚Äôs Russia.

Central to the series is data. Our teams of reporters and researchers have spent months analysing ship movements, ownership details, vessel routes and import records to document the extent of Europe‚Äôs role in shipping fossil fuels out of Russia. The visualisations were produced in partnership with the Innovation Lab at Tagesspiegel, our media partner in Germany, and are being updated on a regular basis.

Most of them are Black, and most of them have been there before.

The Cleveland community has been blindfolded in trying to understand how systemic unfairness stacks up ‚Äî including arrests and charging decisions, access to bail, plea bargains, and sentencing. With our ground-breaking local investigation, ‚ÄúTestify,‚Äù The Marshall Project is uncovering the inner workings of justice in the historically opaque Cuyahoga County Justice system.","Like many places, felony court data in Cleveland is both completely open ‚Äî anybody can look up a case on the docket ‚Äî and extremely opaque because the court refuses to release the data it collects. The Marshall Project built a scraper to collect 70,000 court records and counting and instead of hoarding the data for its own stories, journalists created a tool where residents and community members could ask questions that the journalists would answer. 

We held a virtual community office hours event where we connected with Clevelanders to get feedback about our upcoming tool answering data questions about the courts. Cleveland Documenter Seanna Denee said she wanted us to provide data that ‚Äúproves the theory on the street‚Äù ‚Äî evidence that helps us understand our own senses. 

Our on-the-ground engagement reporting and collaboration with Cleveland Documenters (soon to be part of a new publication called Signal Cleveland) built trust in the community and reflected the community‚Äôs questions and concerns about the court system and judges across many platforms. 

The Marshall Project provided the community with a first-of-its-kind analysis of voting patterns that highlighted the fact that mostly white, suburban voters were electing the judges presiding over the cases of mostly Black Cleveland residents. The analysis, which was also shared in an accessible, one-page visual explainer, sparked community conversation. As [Ibram X. Kendi](https://twitter.com/DrIbram/status/1486822436653969416) tweeted, ‚ÄúThis is the power of journalism.‚Äù

We republished the work with a slate of local partners ‚Äî Cleveland Documenters, WOVU, Real Deal Press, The Cleveland Observer (digital and print), The Cleveland Scene (digital and print), The Land, and Ideastream ‚Äî to ensure broad local distribution, and to support Cleveland-based media. We also created [this page](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/01/27/reprint-testify) to make the process of reprinting our work as easy as possible, and translated our visual explainer into Spanish.","We made extensive use of Python, Scrapy, Docker, and Amazon Elastic Cluster Service to acquire the data and load it into PostgreSQL. We used Hasura to provide a GraphQL API, and Observable notebooks to load and analyze the data. 

The website we scraped had many anti-scraping measures and the court has denied direct access to bulk records for years.

To get around them we launched thousands of individual scrapers in the cloud. That also made things slow. Patience was a virtue because it took months of continuous operation to scrape just a few years of case records.

Solving the technical problem was only part of the battle. We still needed to validate whether our scraped data was a comprehensive record of cases with limited cooperation from the court. Through dogged reporting efforts of the entire team, we were able to obtain a list of case numbers from court administrators. While the court would not confirm or deny many of our findings, comparing the list of cases known to the court to the cases we scraped gave us full confidence we had captured the full universe of cases successfully.","While Cuyahoga County allows anyone with access to the internet to look up a person‚Äôs case records, there's no way to use those individual records to assess the records of individual judges, and the court has not released that data publicly. We were able to access and analyze that data. This is what we found:

* Court outcomes worsen existing racial disparities. Though Black people make up only about 30% of the county's residents, almost two-thirds of the people who are arrested by police and charged with felonies by prosecutors are Black. Then, after judges impose sentences, state records show three-quarters of people in state prisons convicted in Cuyahoga County are Black.

* Individual judges make a big difference ‚Äî for example, some judges almost never send defendants to prison for common charges like theft and low-level felony drug possession, while others incarcerate 30% or more.

* While Cleveland residents make up two-thirds of defendants in the court, votes from the city account for less than a quarter of those cast in judges‚Äô races. That means the vote in the predominantly White suburbs in judges‚Äô races effectively carries three times the power of the vote in the majority Black city.

* Voters have more power than they may think. If everyone who showed up to vote had cast ballots for judges as well, that could have swung the outcome in 9 of 15 contested judicial races since 2016 ‚Äî without turning out a single additional voter.

Judges play a key role in the way justice is dispensed. Bringing transparency to how they do their jobs is essential to understanding flaws in the larger system. It‚Äôs also urgent for voters, who have the task of electing them or voting them off the bench. That‚Äôs what The Marshall Project heard from a chorus of academics, attorneys, people who have experienced the system firsthand, and more than 40 residents we worked with Cleveland Documenters to interview.

We also spent months gathering questions from the community, answering their questions and further trying to shed a light on the imbalance in power when it comes to electing judges.

Finally, our reporting on the court system continues: Our most recent investigation, by Wesley Lowery and Ilica Mahajan, found the majority of cases in the system feature defendants with at least one prior charge, and nearly a third have at least five prior criminal cases. The crimes are mostly not violent. A review of hundreds of cases found that most included a defendant who cited drug addiction, mental illness, or both as a factor in their crimes.","1) Courts are worth investigating. After policing, courts are the most important gear in the machinery of mass incarceration in the United States. They are also one of the most opaque. 

2) Analyze geographic concentrations of power. When our understanding of the data was still limited, we were able to rely on easier-to-use public voting datasets combined with geocoded defendant addresses. 

3) Make the work a two-way street. Through our community ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù virtual meetings and our FAQ product, we‚Äôve built channels for engaging with the community.

4) Target tons of platforms and audiences. We‚Äôve shared our reporting in printed fliers, as an illustrated explainer, as an interactive chart, as a page of audio voices, on social platforms like Instagram, in Spanish, at local civic data events, and more.","English, Spanish",https://testify.themarshallproject.org/,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/26/who-s-really-cycling-in-and-out-of-cleveland-s-courts,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/27/testify-repeat-defendant-profile,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/26/how-we-analyzed-cases-of-people-cycling-in-and-out-of-cleveland-s-courts,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/05/09/we-re-answering-your-questions-about-cleveland-s-court-system,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/01/27/who-s-electing-judges-in-the-cleveland-area-not-those-ensnared-in-the-system,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/01/27/we-asked-people-in-cleveland-what-they-want-to-know-about-judges,"Rachel Dissell, Ilica Mahajan, Anna Flagg, Wesley Lowery, Elan Kiderman Ullendorff, Katie Park, Celina Fang, Ashley Dye, Raghuram Vadarevu, John G., Kellie Morris, Michelle Pitcher, Nicole Lewis, Ryan Murphy, Ariel Goodman, Aaron Colby Williams",Available on request.

The Washington Post has compiled [the first database of slaveholding members of Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/) by examining thousands of pages of census records and historical documents.","[The Post‚Äôs list of enslavers in Congress investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/) is the first of its kind. In the process. This project uncoveres facts that alter the way many historical figures have been depicted. The Post‚Äôs work clarifies the record on many men whose relationship to slavery was previously hidden to the public, like Sen. Rufus King, who signed the Constitution and ran for president. Someone who walked past the plaque honoring him in New York City might have searched for him online and found the Wikipedia article extolling his anti-slavery activism. Before The Post‚Äôs project, they would not have found any mention of the fact that he once enslaved someone, too.

The Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, which is the country‚Äôs official source of information on every person who has ever served in Congress, makes almost no mention of slavery. The Post‚Äôs journalism provides a much-needed comprehensive reference.

This story has been strengthened by a unique level of reader involvement. Upon publication of the initial database and analysis, The Post asked readers to help research other possible slaveholders in Congress, eliciting hundreds of responses. Readers sent in remarkable documents: an enslaved grandmother‚Äôs oral history, a great-great-grandfather‚Äôs letter from a Civil War battlefield, newspaper clips showing congressmen seeking the return of escaped enslaved people and handwritten birth certificates showing babies born enslaved.","Journalists from every department of The Washington Post gathered to turn the resulting list of more than 1,800 slaveholders in Congress into a searchable public database and a series of richly designed articles exploring the ways Congress‚Äôs investment in slavery resonates today.

The newsroom-wide effort had more than 40 contributors: from copy editors who checked listings for all 1,875 congressmen in the database, finding and fixing wrinkles in the historical dataset along the way.

The Washington Post built a customized searchable database unique to this project to allow readers to explore the data on their own. The database is one of the largest The Washington Post has ever built and published. Its construction was a painstaking effort, calling for hours of work to combine and check spotty pre-existing datasets on members of Congress and the votes they cast. Technoliges such as R, JavaScript and React were used to process and render the data.

The Washington Post also illustrated this data in creative and compelling ways, including an interactive timeline showing how the share of slaveholders in Congress changed in response to historical events, and a richly detailed map illustrating the trends in all 40 states that sent slaveholders to Congress. The visuals were built using JavaScript's library d3.js, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.","When D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed renaming city buildings because they honored racists, Washington Post reporter Julie Zauzmer Weil scrutinized the list, finding several congressmen who were enslavers. But when she Googled: ‚Äúmembers of Congress who were slaveowners,‚Äù she discovered there was no list. So she set out to create one ‚Äì and to explore the impact those enslavers had on America‚Äôs laws in pursuit of their own wealth and self-interest.

The new availability of factual information on slaveholders in Congress serves the public in many ways as America continues to grapple with how it understands and teaches its history.

Washington Post readers have used the database to learn about their own ancestors. They have looked up the namesakes of their towns‚Äô schools and parks, providing an easy-to-use source of factual information to give context to the ongoing debates in communities across the country about whether to rename public institutions that honor slaveholders. The Post‚Äôs richly designed and intensively researched tour of the art that depicts historical figures inside the U.S. Capitol also contributes to important public debate about who the country honors.

To share this resource with students, The Post commissioned a curriculum guide available to teachers. The Zinn Education Project also promoted the project, leading to invitations for reporter Julie Z. Weil to speak with students at a wide variety of schools.

The database is simple enough to serve people of all ages in becoming better-informed participants in one of the most serious conversations in America today: the dialogue about our past and how it shapes our present.","While much has been written in recent years about the systemic and long-lasting effects of slavery, other publications have not explored the relationship between lawmakers‚Äô own economic interests, the laws they passed, and the ramifications of those laws. This database allows journalists and historians alike to explore that crucial aspect of the American story in a way that was previously inaccessible.

The Washington Post took the unusual step of making the entire dataset from this project publicly accessible on [Github](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners). The freely available data offers a brand-new tool useful for many forms of analysis. For instance, a reporter or a historian writing about any vote in Congress can now use this data to analyze how slaveholders and non-slaveholders voted, providing a valuable new lens that will further scholarship on American history.

A a√ß√£o pastoral da Igreja Cat√≥lica √© de extrema import√¢ncia pela profundidade, cobertura temporal e espacial dos conflitos. Al√©m disso, √© um trabalho perigoso, pelos riscos de se debru√ßar sobre um problema que atravessa d√©cadas no Brasil e que ainda √© atual. Tornar p√∫blico esses dados confronta estruturas de poder nas lutas pela terra-territ√≥rio e fomenta o debate e defesa sobre os direitos dos trabalhadores da terra.

Brazil,g1/globo,Big,Shortlist,,As elei√ß√µes brasileiras em 11136 v√≠deos personalizados | The Brazilian elections in 11136 customized videos,02/10/2022,"Breaking news, Database, Open data, Video, Elections, Politics","Personalisation, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, Javascript, Google Compute Engine, Big Query, Pytesseract, Nexrender","g1 generated and published 11136 customized texts and videos with Brazilian two rounds election results hours after the votings in October 2022. Each had the results for a specific city, including votes and percentages for the President, Governor, and other elected officials. Delivering fast and detailed information for voters was crucial to counter coordinated attacks on the voting systems and false claims of election fraud that had been spreading before the ballot. It was the first time a news outlet released this number of automated election videos in such a short time. The content reached millions of people.","The fast release of 5568 automated texts and videos with results of each Brazilian election round in October 2022 played a significant role in g1/globo effort to inform voters during the fiercest presidential election in the country's history. At that time the fear of massive countrywide protests to overturn the elections was real, and the quick and efficient way the press and Electoral Justice inform the public about the results are tought to have played a key role in preventing demonstrations to scale.

g1/globo managed to deliver text and video with specific data for each Brazilian city, making the results more accessible and easy to search. One of the goals in automating content was to reach very small towns that compose two-thirds of Brazilian cities and are not used to get customized content from the press. 

The strategy of releasing automated content with citywide results was proven right when false messages started to spread showing fake presidential vote counts for Bolsonaro or Lula in specific cities. They could be easily disproven by the automated texts and videos.

Millions of people viewed the automated texts and videos with Brazilian election results.","g1/globo already had experience publishing automated texts in 2020 municipal elections - with great results. Automated videos were the next step to ensure a broader reach, specially on social media. But the format presented many technical challenges, such as processing power, data quality and CMS integration. 

To tackle those technological challenges, a complex data processing pipeline was developed, relying most on cloud technologies using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The advantage of this approach is the possibility of scale by demand besides the resilience of the operation. All data was landed in the JSON format, and the buckets service from Google Cloud Storage was used to store them, the JSON files were converted to AVRO format which is a better format suited for querying and processing with Python scripts, and beyond that, the data is stored in Big Query tables to be consumed by front-end applications such as dashboards, the pipeline flow management is handled by the Dataflow. 

For the video rendering process, virtual machines from Google Compute Engine were used to build a render farm, running on Windows OS. The rendering processing relies upon Adobe After Effects. It is automated by the Nexrender framework, which is written in Javascript and is responsible for ""gluing"" all the data to the videos. At the end of the rendering process, the videos are encoded through the FFMPEG framework. 

For the data quality insurance, an OCR layer is added to the pipeline flow, which is responsible for extracting information from each frame of the video and guaranteeing that it matches the correct data of each city and candidate polling numbers. This system is developed using the Pytesseract framework for the OCR part, and the OCV library for image treatment, such as grayscale tunning and noise reduction.","Brazil held in October 2022 the fiercest presidential election in its history. In a runoff Brazilians ousted President Jair Bolsonaro and elected former President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva after months of disinformation campaigns, coup threats, and violence among voters. Coordinated attacks on the voting systems and false claims of election fraud had been spread by Bolsonaro supporters years before the ballot. 

There was a widespread notion among electoral authorities and the press that after the votes were counted time was of the essence to disperse any attempts to overturn the elections. Delivering the election results in a fast, detailed, and reliable way was essential to assure the public confidence in the voting systems and Democracy itself. 

g1/Globo has been publishing for years detailed election data supplied by the Electoral Justice in charts and interactive pages as soon as they are available, with great success. But not all people find charts friendly and accessible. Many prefer to read a text or watch a video. Besides, specific results for each city are not easily found in search engines.

With that in mind, g1 started publishing automated texts with election results for each of the 5568 Brazilian cities in the 2020 municipal election minutes after the numbers were released. The response was very positive and the content reached a broader public.

The logical step was to adopt one more time text automation to amplify content production in the 2022 elections. Given the political climate though, reaching the maximum possible number of people was not a goal but the top priority. The text was not enough. It had to have a video.

Nonetheless, automating video has a series of challenges, such as processing power, data quality, and CMS integration. And it had never been done at this scale by a news outlet, at least in Brazil.

The project took nine months until it was ready to go live on election day.

United States,Bloomberg News,Big,Shortlist,,Google Maps Regularly Misleads People Searching for Abortion Clinics,15/08/2022,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics, Map, Women","Google Sheets, Python, Node.js, Javascript
Svelte",Bloomberg exposed how services such as Google Maps and Search deliver misleading abortion-related information and how abortion foes collect data on people seeking pregnancy help online. Google changed their practices in response.,"Bloomberg‚Äôs data journalism reporting on abortion information provided by Google Maps and Google Search drew lawmakers‚Äô attention and changed the tech company‚Äôs policy. 

In August, Bloomberg published the story showing that in a quarter of abortion searches, Google Maps ‚Äì the most widely used US navigation tool ‚Äì led users to crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), non-medical organizations that seek to persuade women not to get abortions. In 13 states where abortion was newly criminalized, at least half of the top search results were for CPCs. Ten days later, Google said it will clearly label facilities in the US that provide abortions in search results and in Google Maps.

In September, Bloomberg published another story showing that Google didn‚Äôt do enough to clearly label when advertisers don‚Äôt offer medical services to terminate a pregnancy. In this joint analysis by Bloomberg and the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, we found that in many abortion-related searches, Google still doesn‚Äôt apply the labels for CPCs. That means Google is still collecting ad revenue from CPCs without disclosing that such places do not provide abortions or refer patients to clinics that do. In November, citing Bloomberg‚Äôs reporting, US Senators Mark Warner and Elissa Slotkin wrote to Google‚Äôs CEO to urge the end to deceptive advertising and misrepresentation in search results, and to ensure accurate information for those seeking abortion support.","To determine a users‚Äô experience looking for abortion-related information in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., we wrote a script to generate Google search results by state. Those results were confirmed by searches using virtual private networks with location set to those states, as well as searches by Mechanical Turk workers located in those states.

That technique allowed us to create a database of 510 medical centers that appeared in the top 10 results for each state‚Äôs Google Maps. We then checked them against existing publicly available databases of crisis pregnancy centers and abortion clinics. We then confirmed those categorizations by making calls to experts and clinics themselves.

We built a quiz with Javascript and Svelte that asked readers to see if they could determine whether something was an abortion clinic or a crisis pregnancy center simply by looking at their website. We randomized the visual examples from the database of 510 medical centers that we built for reporting. That quiz was a crucial tool for readers to understand how someone could be easily manipulated by inaccurate results ‚Äì even though Google, through its advertising business, knows which clinics do and don‚Äôt provide abortions.","A historic rollback in reproductive rights turned Google, Snapchat and other tech firms into gatekeepers for information on health care in moments of crisis and confusion. We investigated whether consumers would be well-served by the answers and found that the tech companies had avoided improving the accuracy of their information despite years of warning from advocacy groups and journalists. Bad information could have serious health implications for those in states with new time limits on legal abortion especially. 

The Bloomberg reporters wanted to be the first to quantify and define the tech firms‚Äô lapses, so that the companies could see how they were failing pregnant people at their most vulnerable.
We needed to figure out how the Roe reversal led to geographic inequality in information for the users of tech products, as multiple states outlawed abortion or restricted access to care. We were based in New York, California and Washington, D.C., but found technical ways to understand the experience of someone using their phone to set up an appointment for an abortion in Florida or Texas, for instance. 

In order to accurately map and quantify the results for readers, we went through a meticulous fact-checking process to define which options online were, in fact, crisis pregnancy centers as opposed to legitimate abortion clinics. We cross-checked multiple databases and made calls directly to organizations across the country that advertised abortions.","Data availability is always a challenge when reporting on tech companies. These companies collect so much data from their users but there is rarely any good data available to measure their accountability. The lesson we learned from this story is that through innovative data collection and meticulous fact-checking, it is possible to shed light on these big players and keep them accountable.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-google-search-abortion-clinic-crisis-pregnancy-center/?sref=X1c60Hpu,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-google-search-abortion-clinic-crisis-pregnancy-center-ads/,,,,,,"Davey Alba, Jack Gillum, Cedric Sam

United Kingdom,BBC News,Big,Shortlist,,Heat hazards: Is your area vulnerable to extreme heat?,18/07/2022,"Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Health","QGIS, Json, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, Others, please state","As UK temperatures soared to a record 40C in July 2022, the BBC analysed satellite data to reveal those living in deprived areas were more than twice as likely to be in places vulnerable to high heat levels.

The data analysis provided the basis for a news story and an interactive map that helped put people directly into the story of last year‚Äôs summer heat wave. 

Satellite analytics company 4 Earth Intelligence (4EI), provided the data, which the BBC analysed.","As well as being used widely across BBC News outlets, the story was featured on the Apple News daily spotlight.

The Red Cross, plan to use the map as a tool to assist with future planning for heatwaves. It was also shared with the charity‚Äôs Community Resilience Team.","We used two levels of data for this story, postcode (zipcode) level to build the interactive map, and neighbourhood level (lower super output area or LSOA) data for the deprivation analysis.

4 Earth Intelligence used a statistical method published by academics to standardise land surface temperatures for each postcode and LSOA area, which involved combining satellite images for different dates over the past three years.

The temperature data was then adjusted to consider the different average temperatures of each region, to highlight hotter areas across the country, despite varying climates and temperatures.

A score, ranging from one to five, was then assigned to each postcode and LSOA. The score is an indicator of how likely it is that the area will experience high temperatures during hot weather, when compared with other areas in the surrounding neighbourhood.

The data team took the score for each LSOA area and cross-referenced it with the Index of Multiple Deprivation for each country, to establish if people living in more deprived areas were more vulnerable to high heat.

The design and development team took the postcode-level data and created an interactive map, allowing audiences to bring the story to their doorstep and make it more relevant to them.

Meanwhile, using the data our reporting team went to areas in England, Scotland and Wales experiencing high heat and high levels of deprivation to learn about the impacts this was having on people's wellbeing. They gathered moving case studies of vulnerable people suffering in the heat, giving voice to those who struggle in heat waves each year.

This project was achieved through the use of R, QGIS, Zoomstack, Adobe XD, Photoshop and traditional broadcast reporting.","The data was exclusively released to the BBC by 4 Earth Intelligence shortly after COP26, which had been held in Glasgow.

The granularity of the data was such that processing the data and boundaries for 1.8 million unique postcode files presented major technical challenges for our developers. They came up with an innovative solution not to use a vector map showing the heat scores/zones of each area, but to render the map as a series of image tiles. We layered the postcode polygons on top. 

So, when a postcode was searched only the immediately relevant data was shown. This took the burden of rendering the map and all associated data away from the user, as it was handled by our servers.","- It‚Äôs easy to forget satellite data can be used in ways beyond just mapping
- Not all stories are available in open data
- Don‚Äôt be daunted by projects involve large amounts of data, you don‚Äôt need to have all the answers when you start

Brazil,Aos Fatos,Small,Shortlist,,"Em 1.459 dias como presidente, Bolsonaro mentiu 6.685 vezes",29/12/2022,"Investigation, Database, Fact-checking, Chart, Elections, Politics","Scraping, Google Sheets, Python","Durante os quatro anos de governo de Jair Bolsonaro, uma equipe de mais de 20 profissionais do Aos Fatos se engajou em acompanhar diariamente o que ex-presidente do Brasil dizia. Com um time de rep√≥rteres, editores, programadores e l√≠deres de inova√ß√£o, a organiza√ß√£o desenvolveu m√©todos e novas tecnologias para dar conta da empreitada.

Desse modo, Aos Fatos analisou ininterruptamente discursos, entrevistas, lives, redes sociais, entre outras apari√ß√µes p√∫blicas de Bolsonaro, para entender quais foram os principais alvos de sua batalha contra a verdade factual. O resultado foi um trabalho abrangente e meticuloso que mostra a ascens√£o do golpismo no Brasil.","Um dos impactos mais not√°veis da cobertura sobre todas as mentiras ditas por Bolsonaro foi o ent√£o candidato √† Presid√™ncia Lula mencionar, durante o principal debate das elei√ß√µes de 2022, ao vivo, que Bolsonaro havia mentido, at√© ent√£o, 6.498 vezes durante o seu mandato, atribuindo o dado ao Aos Fatos. Isso gerou repercuss√£o sem precedentes:

- O portal UOL repercutiu nas suas redes (TikTok, YouTube, Twitter) o registro de Lula (https://www.tiktok.com/@uol/video/7159763525135600902) alcan√ßando cerca de 10 milh√µes de seguidores;
- O debate gerou recorde de audi√™ncia, a maior em 16 anos, segundo o jornal Valor Econ√¥mico;
- Jornais como Correio Braziliense e Di√°rio de Pernambuco tamb√©m repercutiram.

Outro impacto substancial da cobertura foi ter subsidiado um pedido de abertura de inqu√©rito que apura a participa√ß√£o de Bolsonaro na incita√ß√£o aos atos que culminaram na invas√£o do Congresso Nacional, do Pal√°cio do Planalto e do Supremo Tribunal Federal em 8 de janeiro de 2023. Esse documento, encaminhado em 12 de janeiro de 2023 ao procurador-geral da Rep√∫blica, Augusto Aras, afirma que ""Bolsonaro tem sugerido em diversas manifesta√ß√µes p√∫blicas, desde setembro de 2021"" que as ""institui√ß√µes democr√°ticas n√£o s√£o confi√°veis"". A informa√ß√£o foi retirada deste projeto. Esse pedido foi acatado e, hoje, o ex-presidente est√° sob investiga√ß√£o.

A investiga√ß√£o tamb√©m foi mencionada em ve√≠culos internacionais, como Poynter, Deustch Welle e Washington Post. O que √© mais not√°vel na imprensa brasileira, no entanto, √© que Aos Fatos criou uma cultura de acompanhamento sistem√°tico das falas de Bolsonaro, tornando mais comum no notici√°rio do pa√≠s an√°lises cr√≠ticas de declara√ß√µes falsas ou enganosas dele e de demais pol√≠ticos que se utilizam da mentira como arma pol√≠tica.

O projeto tamb√©m foi uma ferramenta √∫til para mapear o golpismo de Bolsonaro e produzir investiga√ß√µes que ajudam a explicar o contexto dos atos golpistas de 8 de janeiro: https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/bolsonaro-mentiras-quatro-anos-de-golpismo/.","Em 2019, diante da perspectiva de que Bolsonaro emularia Donald Trump e seria um mentiroso contumaz em seu governo, Aos Fatos preparou um banco de dados p√∫blico de declara√ß√µes do presidente, organizado por temas e por origem das declara√ß√µes: https://www.aosfatos.org/todas-as-declara%C3%A7%C3%B5es-de-bolsonaro/. O banco de dados foi desenvolvido em Django e era primeiramente integrado a uma tabela din√¢mica do servi√ßo Google Spreadsheets. Em 2021, devido √† enorme quantidade de dados e dificuldade de sincroniza√ß√£o, foi integrado totalmente ao CMS nativo do Aos Fatos.

Tamb√©m no in√≠cio da cobertura, Aos Fatos vasculhava manualmente ve√≠culos jornal√≠sticos, p√°ginas oficiais nas redes sociais e documentos do governo em busca de declara√ß√µes p√∫blicas do presidente. Isso demandava um gasto de tempo e de recursos humanos muito grande: ao menos um rep√≥rter e um editor usavam mais de dois dias inteiros de trabalho na semana entre o mapeamento das falas, a checagem e a publica√ß√£o. No fim de 2021, Aos Fatos desenvolveu a ferramenta Escriba (https://escriba.aosfatos.org/), de transcri√ß√£o autom√°tica de v√≠deos e √°udios com grande acur√°cia. Isso acelerou o processo de acompanhamento das declara√ß√µes. O ganho de produtividade para essa atividade foi de aproximadamente 150h/m√™s, em m√©dia.

Foi assim que conseguimos chegar ao n√∫mero de quatro mentiras por dia ditas por Bolsonaro.

Ou seja, al√©m de ter gerado impacto externo, mudando a cultura de cobertura de declara√ß√µes de pol√≠ticos no Brasil, o projeto de monitoramento das mentiras de Bolsonaro causou uma revolu√ß√£o interna de produtividade no Aos Fatos.","Aos Fatos considera o contador de mentiras de Bolsonaro um projeto de longo prazo cujo impacto s√≥ poderia ser medido ao fim do mandato do ex-presidente, em 2022. Portanto, seria imposs√≠vel dizer em 2019, quando planejamos essa cobertura, o potencial que ele teria, tanto do ponto de vista de repercuss√£o, quanto da capacidade de finaliz√°-lo e consolid√°-lo como um documento completo.

Com um projeto semelhante, o Washington Post teve dificuldades em finalizar sua cobertura: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/. Aos Fatos, com uma equipe de 10 a 15 jornalistas e metodologia de checagem consistente, publicou seus resultados pontualmente em 29 de dezembro de 2022.

Imprescind√≠vel ressaltar que, por conta de sua cobertura de desinforma√ß√£o, Aos Fatos foi severamente atacado ao longo dos anos Bolsonaro. N√£o s√≥ este projeto, mas todas as opera√ß√µes do Aos Fatos ‚Äì da checagem de fatos √†s investiga√ß√µes de campanhas de desinforma√ß√£o ‚Äì sofreram com ass√©dio judicial e campanha de √≥dio nas redes. Desde 2018, antes do in√≠cio oficial da campanha presidencial daquele ano, jornalistas do Aos Fatos j√° sofriam doxxing e amea√ßas de viol√™ncia por conta de seu trabalho. Tamb√©m como resultado de seu trabalho, o perfil do Aos Fatos no Twitter foi bloqueado pelo perfil oficial de Bolsonaro, dificultando o mapeamento de suas declara√ß√µes. 

Em 2022, Bolsonaro afirmou em entrevista o seguinte: ""Geralmente, quem busca tolher a liberdade e impor um regime de for√ßa √© o chefe do Executivo. Aqui √© exatamente o contr√°rio. Aqui √© o chefe do Executivo que resiste a ag√™ncias de checagem, a arbitrariedades estapaf√∫rdias. Duas ou tr√™s pessoas passam a valer mais do que todos n√≥s juntos, que a C√¢mara, que outros √≥rg√£os do Judici√°rio. Vamos ceder para dois ou tr√™s?"" Este √© s√≥ um exemplo. 

Quando do planejamento desta cobertura, Aos Fatos n√£o sabia que eventos como os de 8 de janeiro de 2023 poderiam vir a ocorrer. No entanto, j√° era poss√≠vel ver o valor deste projeto √† medida que as elei√ß√µes de 2022 se aproximavam e que os ataques golpistas de Bolsonaro ficavam mais virulentos. 

S√≥ em 2022, por conta deste projeto, Aos Fatos produziu as seguintes reportagens, comprovando uso de dinheiro p√∫blico para patrocinar atos golpistas, negacionismo e conspira√ß√£o contra o sistema eleitoral brasileiro:

- Secom pagou R$ 3,2 mi para veicular discursos golpistas e mentiras de Bolsonaro na TV Brasil (https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/secom-tvbrasil-mentiras-bolsonaro/)

- Bolsonaro mentiu mais de quatro vezes por dia durante governo (https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/mentiras-bolsonaro/)","Jornalistas gestores de reda√ß√µes podem aprender, se j√° n√£o aprenderam, que duas posturas s√£o importantes:

- Mesmo diante de adversidades financeiras, investimento em cobertura de longo prazo se traduz em impacto na ind√∫stria e na pol√≠tica, com retorno de leitores fi√©is;
- Projetos de monitoramento constante mudam a cultura pol√≠tica brasileira. Nunca se falou tanto em volume de mentiras e da necessidade de respaldar pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas com evid√™ncias verific√°veis;
- √â importante integrar projetos √† rotina da empresa jornal√≠stica: o contador de mentiras de Bolsonaro gerou demanda por investimento tecnol√≥gico na reda√ß√£o, o que, com o Escriba, facilitou a vida de todos os rep√≥rteres da organiza√ß√£o.

Fazer checagem sistem√°tica de declara√ß√µes tamb√©m cria um constrangimento √† tradi√ß√£o do jornalismo declarat√≥rio e estenogr√°fico.

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Shortlist,,How space debris threatens modern life,08/06/2022,"Explainer, Long-form, Infographics, Economy","Animation, 3D modeling, Three.js, Canvas, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, Python, Blender
React
Shapr3D","The story outlined the looming threat of space debris in low-Earth orbit and the consequences of not addressing or mitigating the problem. We built the story as a 3D, scrolling explainer, constructing a number of scenes in orbit to explain important concepts that would be difficult to articulate through text or static charts alone.

The project was produced in collaboration with Peggy Hollinger, International Business Editor at the FT, who has covered the commoditisation of space extensively. The reporting involved conversations with officials from ESA and NASA, as well as various other researchers, experts, and astronauts.","The article was a hit with readers, with roughly a quarter reading the entire piece. The article was also published to coincide with the FT Investing In Space conference and used to frame discussions about how we can best mitigate against the growing issue of space debris.

The piece was also widely shared on social media and repackaged into one of the FT‚Äôs best performing Instagram reels of the year. The combination of in-depth reporting and 3D visuals helped us take the FT‚Äôs reporting ‚Äî and the complex world of space ‚Äî to a younger audience.","The project is built within a React frame, using a scrollytelling component developed by our team. The main visuals use the ThreeJS/React-Three-Fiber libraries to manipulate and navigate around complex 3D models. 

Some of these models were constructed by us, while others were sourced from third-parties and modified in Blender. Aligning the events and camera for each section to work across devices involved a lot of work, as did navigating performance concerns. 

We had to make concessions on detail and accuracy to ensure that the page could load in a reasonable amount of time and run relatively smoothly across a range of mobile devices. We also had to consider tradeoffs between literal and conceptual accuracy, a challenge magnified by the physical scale of many of the concepts.

We outlined the project in Figma and wireframed out each ‚Äúscene‚Äù in the story, determining which concepts benefitted from complex 3D scenes and which were better-served by short text sections or static charts. In one particularly complex section, we determined that explaining the impact of various anti-satellite missile tests would work best as some kind of chart, but would benefit from incorporating the scale of the 3D scene, so we constructed a dynamic chart in 3D space.

For the views of all satellites and tracked debris, we used real positional data from www.space-track.org to calculate real point-in-time positions based on orbit ascensions, inclinations and periods.

The lighting and colour palette were of particular importance against a dark background, as was the positioning and styling of text cards. But to address accessibility concerns, we offered readers who struggle with dark text on light backgrounds an alternative reading experience via a toggle on the landing page.","Accumulation of space debris in low-Earth orbit is a considerable threat to our future livelihoods, but it is an issue that we have the time to mitigate or solve. One researcher we spoke to equated it to ‚Äúclimate change in the early 20th century‚Äù.

One challenge we faced in the piece was conveying the importance of an issue that is, literally, very far away and explaining that we have come to rely on this area of space for much more than space travel. 

We tried to communicate some of the ways that satellites in low-Earth orbit impact our lives through a mini ‚Äútour‚Äù of satellites at the beginning of the story. Should more collisions, minor or catastrophic, occur and debris continue to accumulate, we risk creating an environment in which satellites are unable to effectively operate and the services we have come to rely on them for ‚Äî navigation, communication, climate modeling ‚Äî become difficult or impossible to maintain. 

Additionally, while the current volume of active satellites and debris represents a concern, plans by SpaceX and others to put tens of thousands of new satellites into orbit pose an even greater challenge. 

NASA has raised concerns about the volume and capabilities of these satellites, but Musk has brushed them off, stating that he believes there is room in low-Earth orbit for ‚Äútens of billions‚Äù of satellites to operate (NASA and many experts disagree).

We devoted a long section at the end of the piece to potential solutions, but many of these rely on regulations or restrictions that no single entity has the power to enforce. Ultimately, operators such as SpaceX (or Amazon‚Äôs Project Kuiper) will largely be able to do as they please until enforceable and consistent regulations are in place.

Space debris is an issue many consider distant or unimportant, but a failure to take action could have disastrous consequences for life on Earth. We believe that through providing a visually-compelling explanation of the threat it poses we can correct these misconceptions.","We hope that this story serves as a compelling example of incorporating 3D models and visualisations in a way that aids understanding, rather than distracts. For the right kind of project, breaking outside of the axes and working with a truly blank canvas can make for a more compelling or precise explanation of a concept or complex topic (if time allows!). 

While our project pushed up against some performance limits, we were also surprised by how much we were able to get to work reasonably well across browsers and devices. The speed of even the slowest mobile devices get better every year and can handle increasingly complex formats. It is an exciting time for journalism, and we hope this story serves as inspiration for those who want to produce cutting edge visual stories in the digital age.",English,https://ig.ft.com/space-debris/,,,,,,,"Sam Learner, Peggy Hollinger, Sam Joiner, Caroline Nevitt, Ian Bott","The visual components of the story were created by members of the FT's visual storytelling team, an interdisciplinary group of journalists combining data, design, coding and reporting skills. The team focus on projects where visual elements play an essential role in communicating the story, working on everything from investigations to explainers across the spectrum of news and features.

On this story, we worked in collaboration with Peggy Holinger, an International Business Editor at the FT, who has covered the commoditisation of space extensively."

The coordinated sharing of scripted messages exposed in this work showed how social media is used to paint a false narrative.","This project exposed many sockpuppet twitter accounts that called for the Finance Minister to stay in office. After the investigation, the 292 tweet accounts were exposed and stopped the coordinated sharing of tweets under the #KenMustStay.
The public became aware that #KenMustStay was a fake trend. The story generated widespread discussions.","1. Truthnest: I used the application to analyse the tweets of the users. This helped me identify the number of times Twitter accounts had used a particular hashtag. It also showed the link between Twitter users tweeting one hashtag. The application made it easy for me to see the coordinated nature of the users of #KenMustStay. Truth nest also helped me identify the accounts that are BOTS.
2. Tweetbeaver: This application helped me to easily to find linkages between Twitter users. It helped me easily the relationship between Twitter users.
3. Meltwater helped me to know the number of tweets garnered under the two hashtags. It made it easy for me to monitor the tweet behaviours of various twitter users under investigation.","In Ghana, we have a group of people on social media called ""Agenda Boys"" These people are usually accused of taking money and pushing a particular narrative. They have a network of people who have created faceless accounts and send large volumes of tweets and make any hashtag appear in trends. These people can create a false narrative. If care is not taken, the public and policymakers may be swayed by the views expressed on social media.

Women Face Wage Discrimination In Both The Public And Private Sectors,19/12/2022,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Audio, Women, Human rights","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python","The investigation relies on analyzing wage bulletin data issued by the Egyptian Statistical Center, during the last five years, to prove the gap in wages between women and men in the public and private sectors in various professions, in violation of Egyptian law.
The data showed that, the wage gap did not narrow, but rather increased. 
According to data analysis, this disparity is equivalent to a 28% difference in income between men and women in the public and private sectors.
in light of the absence of any role from the workforce, and the Manpower Committee in the House of Representatives.","When he spoke with the National Wages Council in Egypt, the official told me that this is the first time he has heard about this problem and that they have not discussed this issue before, so I am one of the first to talk about this issue in a data-driven investigation.
I also spoke to the head of the Parliament‚Äôs Manpower Committee, Adel Abdel-Fadil, and they are now in the process of finalizing the new labor law, and he said that he had never heard of this problem and they did not discuss it in the House of Representatives, and after publishing the investigation, he told me that he would discuss this issue in the House of Representatives, and during the discussion of the law new work.
She also sent the investigation to the head of the National Council for Women and officials in the workforce and civil society to discuss this topic in the new law.","First we used PDF scraping tools like Tabula and Python.
We also used Excel to clean and analyze the data, and Fluorish and DataRubber were used to represent the data.
And I used audicity to lead the podcast.
We used Photoshop for graphics, and Adobe Premiere for video editing.","First, everyone knows that Egypt and the Middle East have become an unsafe environment for the work of journalists, especially investigative reports. It is enough for you to criticize any responsible party to refrain from dealing with you again, in addition to the difficulties in dealing with official sources and their fear of talking to journalists so that they do not lose their jobs, too. Dealing with cases of women, especially those working in government agencies, so we had to hide their identities so that they would not be subject to prosecution. One of the officials asked me for the information of the employee who spoke to me and works in the Tax Authority, and I refused and told him that you do not have the right to pursue women who suffer from discrimination in wages. So instead of resolving the crisis, you pursue them and dismiss them from their work?

Officials also deny that there is discrimination in wages between the sexes, even the Ministry of Manpower, although the ministry has established a unit to combat gender discrimination!
Also, the difficulties that journalists face in developing their work and skills, as there is very little material in the Arabic language, so I hope that we will be given more training and resources to hone our skills in data journalism.","We can use open source and official data to create a data-driven investigation that condemns the very entity that issues the data.
We used labor force data to confront the Ministry of Manpower itself with wage discrimination between men and women.
Data journalism can also be used to support gender and marginalized groups. Officials often tell us that these cases in our investigations are an individual case, but with data over several years we can prove that the problem is not an individual case and many women suffer from it in all Egyptian governorates. over different years, and that the wage gap increases rather than decreases with the passage of years.",Arabic and English,https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2022/12/14/%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%8F%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%8A/,https://en.sharikawalaken.media/the-wage-gap-cannot-be-bridged-women-face-wage-discrimination-in-both-the-public-and-private-sectors/,,,,,,Menna abdel Razek,"An Egyptian investigative and data reporter with more than eight years of experience.

We also exposed leaks by several other actors in the health sector.

When we asked Meta what happened with the data, they responded, ‚Äú[O]ur systems are designed to remove potentially sensitive data‚Äù. By creating our own virtual, fake online pharmacy and a robot customer, we showed that Meta in fact, and contrary to their claim, stored such information.","As a direct consequence of the first part of our project, all actors mentioned in our stories reported their data breaches to the Swedish Data Protection Authority, removed or deactivated the Meta Pixel and initiated internal investigations.

The Swedish Data Protection Authority opened formal investigations into three pharmacy chains and the online health care provider Kry/Livi, which had shared, for example, e-mail addresses of patients and doctors with Meta. Kry told us that their data breach had affected an estimated 90,000 users across several European countries. All of the authority's investigations may or may not lead to fines under the GDPR.

We were also able to use the software we developed in the project to expose leaks from membership application forms of two political parties in Sweden.

In the second part of our project, we showed that Meta ‚Äì despite filters, their own data policies and claims to notify advertisers who send them sensitive data ‚Äì in fact stored information about medications, diagnoses and illnesses sent from our fake pharmacy via the Meta Pixel, contradicting their statements made to us. 

Our investigation was the first to test the robustness of Meta‚Äôs filtering systems for health data, raising questions such as which languages they had trained it to work on and whether it worked in Swedish at all.

‚ÄúFor sale: your health‚Äù was shortlisted for the 2022 edition of the Swedish Grand Prize for Journalism as Innovator of the Year.","We developed several tools. In 2021, we created a ‚Äúfirst detection‚Äù tool in Python and Selenium to identify websites that share data with third parties. Essentially, it is a scanner that:

1. goes to a given website, 
2. stays there for a while, and then 
3. downloads, among other things, the network traffic between the browser and third parties.

In 2022, we added a function that automatically interacts with cookie boxes in multiple languages. If our scanner finds certain third parties in the network data it can, for example, determine if there is a high likelihood that the website shares personally identifiable data with Meta.

We also have a tool in Python that identifies personal data a website has shared with a third party. We built the first version of this tool in 2021, and in 2022, we added support to include metadata (about, for example, pharmacy products).

We built our fake pharmacy using Vue.js, and our robot customer using Python and Selenium. We manually compiled the sensitive data used in our pharmacy and by our robot. To analyze what Meta was doing with the data, we mapped API calls made within the Facebook Ads Management tool and found that one of them contained names of medications, types of diagnoses and more ‚Äì stored on Meta‚Äôs servers. We regularly made requests to this endpoint, and could see that Meta repeatedly stored the same kind of sensitive information they had told us their systems remove.

After confronting Meta with our results, we noticed that employees at the company began visiting our pharmacy. When the company got back to us, they did not answer our questions (for example: can the filter detect sensitive health information in Swedish?) but emphasized the responsibility of the advertiser.","In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that health apps were transferring sensitive health information to Facebook. Two years later, New York State investigators issued a report saying that Facebook had taken measures to block the collection of sensitive data. A central component was a filtering mechanism designed to prevent Facebook from storing sensitive health data. As far as we know, we are the first journalists to investigate how robust this filtering mechanism is.

Our reporting on the Meta Pixel began in 2021. In June of that year, we exposed leaks of user data (i.e. emails) from the websites of two Swedish banks. We believe this was the first time that journalists had reported on the contents of specific parameters (i.e. user emails) being transferred through the Pixel over the web (whereas the WSJ had looked at app traffic).

In early 2022, we began to investigate actors that handle sensitive health information, resulting in the revelations submitted here for your consideration. The first story, about a mental health charity passing on personal data submitted by users of its online forum, was published in early April. Among other things, Meta collected the users‚Äô emails when they registered or logged in, at time including the ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù nickname that the charity had auto-generated for each new forum user.

We then continued to publish stories in the investigative series ‚ÄúFor sale: your health‚Äù.
A few weeks after our first story in the series, other outlets, including The Markup, began to report on US examples of sensitive data collected by Meta via the Meta Pixel. Those stories raised awareness of Meta's data gathering in the US, resulting in political scrutiny of the company‚Äôs practices and class-action lawsuits","Our investigations into personal data breaches via online tracking usually follow a pattern that has become almost too predictable:

**Step 1.** We tell the company/actor what they are doing.
**Step 2.** The company/actor denies this, and tell us that they cannot reproduce our results.
**Step 3.** We provide a step-by-step manual on how to verify our claims.
**Step 4.** The company/actor stop their transfers and report themselves to the data protection authority.
**Step 5.** The company claim they were completely unaware of the transfers.

All of this shows that even though the GDPR became law five years ago, companies and actors entrusted with sensitive data lack the tools and knowledge to survey their own handling of such data on their public platforms online. 

In addition, we believe that these types of breaches are generally under-reported by the media, yet of great public interest judging by our audience‚Äôs engagement with what we have published so far. In other words, finding and exposing data breaches and digging deep into what happens with the information once shared with a third party has proven an area ripe for exploration by investigative journalists.

For two years, we have asked Meta questions relating to what happens with data after they have received it. Their responses have seldom been clear-cut, and often lead to more questions that they either do not answer or answer with more ambiguity. This could often be where the investigation ends, unless you have sources from within the company. 

Our work shows that there is an alternative: sometimes you can use the tech company‚Äôs own products to investigate their claims when they refuse to answer your questions.",Swedish,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/ekot-byggde-fejkapotek-avslojar-hur-facebook-lagrat-kanslig-information?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/du-kopte-klamydiatest-apoteket-berattade-for-facebook?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/apoteket-delade-kunders-uppgifter-med-facebook-det-var-fel-vi-beklagar?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/kry-lanserade-saker-tjanst-lackte-till-facebook?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/efter-facebook-lackorna-myndighet-granskar-tre-apotek?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/efter-ekots-avslojande-kry-ska-granskas-av-myndighet?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,,"Sascha Granberg, Sven Carlsson","Sascha Granberg works as an investigative data journalist at Sveriges Radio Ekot.

Besides the ecological damage, this pollution flows into dams supplying drinking water to citizens. Further, data shows drinking water fails to meet minimum standards in two thirds of all municipalities responsible for potable water supply, and many fail to provide any water for days, sometimes weeks at a time. Through a series of stories, we exposed this systemic national failure and its devastating effects.","The project had a series of significant impacts.

Our reporting on sewage pollution in Cape Town, which laid the foundation for this nationwide investigation, contributed to Cape Town's new mayor, who was elected on 1 November 2021, declaring sewage pollution a top priority during his campaign. He removed the previous political head of water and sanitation in the city, and spent his first day in office visiting particularly egregious sites of pollution. The city now makes the results of its inland and coastal water quality tests public.

The nationwide Green Drop Report, which is a national regulatory audit of the country‚Äôs wastewater treatment, was resumed in 2021 after being halted in 2016. We believe these stories, and others which led up to these, may have had some influence.

The project had widespread distribution, as many of the stories were republished by some of the most respected news outlets in Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, Nigeria, The Gambia, Mali, and the United States. It earned professional recognition, being named one of the best investigative projects in sub-Saharan Africa for 2022 by the [GIJN](https://gijn.org/2022/12/08/2022s-best-investigative-stories-from-sub-saharan-africa/). 

Teamembers were invited to talk about the research at universities, conferences and debates. This included a successful application to speak at the continent-wide African Investigative Journalism Conference (AIJC) in Johannesburg, SA and the University of Lorraine in Metz, France, among others.

Finally, researchers, NGO‚Äôs, advocacy groups and other colleagues got inspired by our work and approached us for our methodology and data. Most notably, InfoNile, a non-profit cross-border group of data and geo journalists, contacted us to follow up on our investigation and methodology to cover the situation in the Nile River Basin.","* We used our [Wazimap NG](https://wazimap-ng.com/) platform to build an instance called [Water Wazi ZA](https://water-wazi-za.openup.org.za/), that showcases Effluent and Potable Water data.

These municipalities, predominantly managed by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) or a political coalition headed by the ANC - with the exception of Cape Town - are essentially dysfunctional and would either fail to respond to queries, or have no channels of communication with the media. In order to determine the causes of water and sanitation failure and gain insight into the state of sewage and water treatment plants, we often had to go outside of official channels and speak to workers and supervisors at the respective plants. This required gaining their trust, where possible, and protecting them as sources as they would lose their jobs for speaking to the media.

We also had to contact community activists or local opposition politicians in order to gain a better understanding of local water and sanitation issues. In order to speak to residents hardest hit by water and sanitation failure, we had to knock on doors in the poorest areas which, in the context of South Africa‚Äôs high crime rate was often a dangerous undertaking given these areas are known to suffer from high levels of crime within a country with the [third-highest global crime ranking](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/crime-rate-by-country).

Despite its importance, the need for hard data on water access and quality remains high to this day, even 13 years after the [United Nations declared](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml#:~:text=On%2028%20July%202010%2C%20through,realisation%20of%20all%20human%20rights.) access to water and sanitation a universal human right. The lack of localized data makes it difficult to pinpoint problems within specific communities. This project is part of our long-term commitment to build a repository of water-related articles, where civil society actors can actively source and share accurate water-related information. We do that by creating an open platform that regularly monitors South Africa‚Äôs online news media for water-related articles.

For Open Up, the project represented the latest development in its ongoing work on Water Wazi, a tool that seeks to integrate various levels of demographic and water data. This year‚Äôs feature included geo-locating a series of water-related articles. Together, our team mines the data to identify noteworthy communities, locations, events, organizations and themes, and maintains an open water data repository to provide the public with reporting resources.

We want to be clear that we see this as a first example of how to build similar resources for this and other topics in other countries. In addition, we used the project as an opportunity to continue to deepen our presence in the metaverse. We are one of few journalism organizations in the world that has a metaverse designer as a core team member. She worked closely with the rest of the team to develop that innovative technology, distribution, and conversation space. This included using Google Street Map to create a truly immersive space that closely resembled physical conditions on the ground.","Across South Africa, there are weekly reports of water and sanitation failure in local and regional publications, but these often lack contextual reporting, and are reactive. By making journalists aware of the availability of national water and sanitation data which is granulated down to every sewage treatment works and water purification plant in the country, journalists can contextualize these failures both historically and within a broader geography. Journalists can also monitor water and sanitation performance in their town, city, or region and proactively report on the dangers to human health and ecology. Further, links between failure in sewage treatment and drinking water standards can be observed and investigated. 

The Water Data Repo is a project led by CCIJ in collaboration with OpenUp to address the data needs of journalists, activists, academics and technologists working on water-related projects in South Africa and beyond. We do that by creating an open platform that regularly monitors each South Africa‚Äôs online news media for water-related articles.

It was the first headline finding of KHN senior correspondent Noam N. Levey‚Äôs yearlong investigation into a staggering failure of U.S. health care: It systematically pushes patients into debt.
 
KHN‚Äôs **Diagnosis: Debt** project pulled back the curtain on this crisis, the true scale of which had been obscured even from many policymakers and medical practitioners. The investigation ‚Äì in digital, audio and broadcast stories ‚Äì exposed what is now an epidemic of medical debt that is now a defining feature of the nation‚Äôs health care system.","**Diagnosis: Debt** has catalyzed a growing national discussion about medical debt. KHN‚Äôs findings were cited prominently in a successful November ballot initiative in Arizona to expand patient protections. And federal regulators at the CFPB asked subjects from Levey‚Äôs story to provide public testimony about nursing homes suing friends and families of residents and then stepped up investigation of the industry‚Äôs debt collection practices. 

The stories prompted good Samaritans to come forward to help relieve the debts of people profiled by KHN, several of whom had their entire debt settled, KHN learned. In December, Aledade, a physician-led company that supports primary care providers, cited the project when it paid to help retire the debt of more than 85,000 patients in Louisiana and Mississippi. In the announcement, Aledade founder Dr. Farzad Mostashari called the series ‚Äúa complete and utter indictment of the financial structures in our health care system.‚Äù

The project found a large and engaged readership. As a public service, KHN provides all of its coverage to any news outlet to re-publish. And hundreds of media outlets picked up our **Diagnosis: Debt** stories. The stories frequently appeared in the ‚ÄúTop Stories‚Äù in Apple News. Our coordinated social media posts with NPR garnered hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of comments. Key stories were translated for Spanish and Chinese audiences. 

Levey‚Äôs findings informed an episode of Tradeoffs, a health care podcast. A callout to readers pulled in hundreds more heart-wrenching stories, which we expect to inform further reporting this year.","The guiding imperative of **Diagnosis: Debt** was to bring to light the sacrifices of Americans victimized by a system that is supposed to take care of them. Building on hundreds of interviews with patients and families, KHN and our partners at NPR and CBS News gave voice to families forced from their homes, new parents driven to take on extra work, and retirees pushed to bankruptcy because of debt. They were people like Monica Reed, a Knoxville woman whose cancer left her with $10,000 in bills. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt buy a lot of food, just plain and simple‚Äù she said. Or Penelope Wingard, a North Carolina woman who could not book appointments when she fell behind on bills. ‚ÄúMy hair hadn‚Äôt even grown back from chemo,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I couldn‚Äôt see my oncologist.‚Äù
 
The project drew on a nationwide poll designed with KFF, new research into debt and hospital finances, and original investigations by KHN reporters. These included a review of thousands of court records to expose debt collection by nursing homes, an analysis of hospital contracts obtained through public records requests, and a yearlong examination of billing policies at hundreds of U.S. hospitals, many of whom resisted public disclosures.","One of the health systems ‚Äì Atrium Health, a public hospital system based in Charlotte ‚Äì threw up multiple barriers to our requests, bringing in an outside counsel and threatening that our records request would cost thousands of dollars to fulfill.

Our investigation of nursing homes that sue the friends and family of residents was based on a database KHN constructed from New York court records. Working over many months, Levey looked at four years of records in one New York county, searching for cases in which nursing homes in the county filed debt collection cases. Each case was entered into a database with key pieces of information, including the debt, who was sued, what allegation was made and how the case was resolved.

We also built a database with public records we obtained from public university hospital systems to analyze how these health systems were using a patient financing company. We entered data from several years‚Äô worth of biweekly reports filed by the company that outlined which loan products patients were in at each hospital. We then analyzed this data to explore how growing numbers of patients were ending up in higher-interest loans the longer each hospital system used the financing company.

The largest database KHN created was built with information gathered about the financial assistance and collection policies of more than 500 hospitals nationwide. We looked at thousands of pages of hospital policies to find what standards hospitals were using to grant assistance and what kind of things hospitals would do to collect unpaid bills, such as suing patients or denying them care. Thousands of pieces of information were entered into the database and analyzed to better understand the prevalence of aggressive collection actions and the wide variation in hospital policies. The database also informed an online interactive map that allows readers to see information about each of the hospitals we researched.","Collecting and verifying the data in the project‚Äôs databases was extremely laborious and time consuming. While it relied on deep thinking and a lot of digging, the tools of the data work were not technically sophisticated. Asking the right questions and methodically organizing the answers can create powerful reporting tools.","English, primarily.

Our analysis suggests that roughly 300,000 students are falling through the cracks of a system meant to help. As one district found, the right support makes a big difference in graduation rates. But federal funding for this work is so low that it doesn‚Äôt come close to covering the true cost.","Our investigation, launched in November, had an immediate impact.

U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees efforts on homelessness, [vowed to discuss undercounting with federal officials](https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/government-helping-homeless-students-mckinney-vento-funding/). Staff for U.S. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska contacted superintendents in his district for answers after Public Integrity‚Äôs analysis showed likely undercounts there. And in December, Congress increased funding for homeless-student support by 13%.

A robust reporting collaboration also put information about the little-known and often-misunderstood requirements to serve homeless students in the hands of more people.

The Center for Public Integrity partnered with The Seattle Times, Street Sense Media and WAMU/DCist, each newsroom producing stories that made use of Public Integrity‚Äôs data analysis. 

We also made the data and other resources available to additional newsrooms pre-publication, part of an innovative national-local collaboration that included a detailed reporting kit and Zoom office hours for reporting help. 

All told, nine newsrooms produced stories with the data. 

The pieces were published in November and December. The potential for more impact is high. 

Both in interviews and the later follow-up by staff for a member of Congress, some school officials responsible for serving homeless students showed confusion about who should be identified and helped. The federal definition includes children doubled-up with friends or extended family out of economic need after losing their home, for instance. Our stories laid out who qualifies and what‚Äôs required.

The December funding increase is a start, but Congress could increase identification and improve support by putting more money toward the effort.


Meanwhile, enforcement of the law is weak. The federal and state departments of education could use a benchmark like ours to flag districts likely undercounting and investigate further. Michigan has guidelines for that.","We used federal education and census data, with acquisition and analysis in the R programming language. We used functions from packages that can be found on https://cran.r-project.org: 

* tidycensus
* tidyverse
* educationdata
* broom
* MASS
* DescTools
* optparse
* assertthat

Our analysis had to overcome a variety of difficulties. Districts that count zero homeless students are permitted to not report that number to the federal homeless enrollment dataset; they simply don‚Äôt appear in it. We created a dataset that adds the missing districts as long as they had actively enrolled students in a given school year.

We then had to gauge the consistency of homeless enrollment data. Education researchers and state departments of education often use eligibility for the National School Lunch Program as a benchmark: The state of Florida, for example, advises school districts that they should ‚Äúconsistently identify at least 5% of their [free- or reduced-price lunch] enrollment as homeless in a school year.‚Äù We derived this benchmark at the school district level using federal data and calculated correlations between the share of students who are homeless and the share of students who are eligible for free- or reduced-price lunch.

To address possible criticism of the limitation of using lunch eligibility as a proxy for poverty, we calculated correlations (using Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient) to evaluate the relationship between homelessness and two other poverty variables. In addition, we calculated separate simple linear regressions in each state and school year. 

In nearly half of states, tallies of student homelessness bear no relationship with poverty, a sign of just how inconsistent the identification of kids with unstable housing can be.","This investigation breaks new ground: Despite reporting about undercounts of homeless students over the years, no media outlet has tried to quantify the gap nationwide. It was quickly apparent why.

Quantifying a lack of data ‚Äì the serious undercounting of homeless students, blocking children and youth from needed help ‚Äì was possible in this case. But it‚Äôs challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the context of what or who is being counted and the process of the count itself.

What it took for us: months of interviews and re-interviews, a lot of internal conversations about methods, then writing a white paper long before publication so experts could review and offer feedback. (We made the [white paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141hZ3a6gYtBCT5IFk_dzkUklVw2zIcXr/view) public.)

Understanding how schools try to identify which of their students are homeless, as well as what support they provide to those they identified, should have been less challenging than the data ‚Äì at least for gathering anecdotes. But this, too, was hard. 

Rarely were school officials eager to discuss this, even though we didn‚Äôt only reach out to districts whose numbers suggested they were doing a poor job at step one. Reporters persisted, both by increasing the number of districts contacted and by not giving up on ones we thought really needed to explain themselves.

This is also where national-local newsroom partnerships shine. At Public Integrity, we had the benefit of time to work through the kinks of the data and keep calling districts; the two reporters from our newsroom worked full time on the project for months. The Seattle Times, Street Sense and WAMU/DCist had the benefit of deep expertise in the context of homelessness in their regions, deep local sourcing and communities who know their reporting well.","Several of the lessons:

* Looking at the way homelessness intersects with something unrelated to housing, such as education, is a powerful way to see how the country ensures (or does not ensure) bedrock concepts like equal access.

* All datasets are missing information. You can potentially piece datasets together to fill in the blanks or create benchmarks to quantify the size of the gap. Additional detail regarding our analysis (including an extended discussion of our assumptions, statistical methods and results) is described in our white paper, linked above.

* Collaborative projects are more powerful than working alone. Reporters and other journalists at each of the partnering newsrooms brought ideas, sources and questions that made the project stronger.

* Housing insecurity is both traumatic and heavily stigmatized. Be especially mindful of that when interviewing sources who are currently experiencing or have experienced homelessness. Fully explain your story and aims. Affirmatively discuss with your source what they are comfortable having printed or aired. If you‚Äôre talking to a family, remember that some members might be OK with you naming them and others might not ‚Äì or, for instance, a parent might be OK being named but not their child or children. Our investigation included a parent who decided, after mulling over it, that it was best not to name her son or show photos of him that showed his entire face. We made sure to accommodate that and ‚Äì because this came up after the photos were taken ‚Äì met with our design editor to figure out which should not be used.",English,https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/schools-fail-to-count-homeless-students/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/one-wa-school-district-helped-homeless-students-graduate-can-others/,https://dcist.com/story/22/11/16/dc-schools-homeless-students-mckinney-vento/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/housing-one-of-biggest-predictors-of-getting-kicked-out-of-wa-schools/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/wa-has-high-number-of-homeless-students-gets-lowest-federal-funding/,https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/government-helping-homeless-students-mckinney-vento-funding/,https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/grim-numbers-on-homeless-students/,"Reporters: Amy DiPierro and Corey Mitchell, Center for Public Integrity; Greg Kim and Anna Patrick, The Seattle Times; Amanda Michelle Gomez, WAMU/DCist; Kaela Roeder, Street Sense Media

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Shortlist,,"Outer Space, our garbage dump",18/10/2022,"Explainer, Chart","Animation, Node.js","Space debris poses a threat to both satellites and future space missions. The littering of space with defunct satellites and old rockets has accelerated dramatically these last years, mainly due to space launches from the private sector, above all Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink project. Experts warn that soon a chain reaction could unfold, where fragments from collisions make parts of Earth‚Äôs orbit dangerous to use. With the help of interactive storytelling and an exclusive data analysis, our project shows how big the problem already is, while also describing what is at stake and what could be done to improve the situation.","For the first time, we are making the entire extent of the space debris problem visible with this project. Comparable projects often only show actual satellites and not even the smallest pieces of space debris that have been created by collisions, for example. We therefore turned to the European Space Agency (ESA) and obtained the data set that ESA itself uses to produce its forecasts. It contains all space debris collisions of the past, as well as sophisticated simulations for the time evolution of the debris cloud.","For the transformation of Kepler to Euclidean coordinates, we used a slightly modified version of the ESA tools Orekit and Orekit Labs (for python bindings). Moreover, we developed a simple physical model for debris particles (ignoring e.g. atmospheric friction) in Orekit to simulate the particle orbits for short time spans. This was necessary to classify the particles according to their orbit types (GEO, LEO, and so on). Since the dataset contained several million rows, we additionally experimented for visualization with an aggregation of particles to a cubic space grid (density) using a self developed search algorithm.

For the representation of the collision, we used 3D models that corresponded to the actual satellites of the 2009 crash. The representation of the Earth in Lower Earth Orbit was realized using an HDRI file. The moving particles showing the distribution of the scrap metal were simulated using X-Particles. For the static satellites and scrap parts we placed light points at the correct position data of the satellites. Detailed 3D models and especially visualizations with hundreds of thousands of points, as used in this project, are much too large to download, let alone animate performantly on cell phones. Therefore, we rendered the data directly into the animation software Cinema 4D and Redshift. This video in turn was then saved in many thousands of frames and displayed on scroll events. This turned out to be the smoothest playback method - especially on older, less powerful smartphone devices.","The data is more accurate and complete than many publicly available catalogs of space debris, which often include positions only for objects that can be tracked by radar. However, this is not possible for debris less than ten centimeters in diameter. Here, only simulations of past collisions and explosions can estimate how much debris was created in each case and how it has spread in orbit over time. Esa uses a model called Master (Meteroid And Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) for this purpose. In the dataset we used, more than 500 space debris events from the past were tracked and combined with data from measuring stations, according to Esa. The computational effort for this is considerable, but in the end a fairly accurate picture of the space debris situation emerges.

When working with large datasets it might be useful to have mathematical and computer science knowledge in the team, as we at ZEIT ONLINE do.","A topic is more nuanced than you might think at first glance, which can pose challenges when showing a visualization of your data. Many media reports about space debris paint a sort or caricature of the problem: A cloud of debris so thick that no rocket can pass through it anymore. In fact, this will probably never happen, as space is really really big. Still, debris is a problem, but more in the sense that it increases the risk from negligible to noticeable: Over time, more and more satellites (and space stations) will be hit by debris, causing them to fail, making spaceflight more expensive and unreliable. 
To the broad public, however, this will probably only become noticeable in a few decades, the experts we interviewed emphasized, while preventive action is required today. The problem is therefore reminiscent of climate change: We have to change our course of action now in order to avoid severe problems in the future.

This was a challenge when developing the visualization of the junk cloud we show in the first part of the story. We wanted it to a) give the right impression while b) still creating a strong visual effect. In the end, we decided to show just those objects from our data set that surpass a specific size, while discussing the balance between alarmism and the long winded nature of the problem openly our story.",German,https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2022-10/weltraumschrott-satelliten-raumfahrt-gefahr-forschung,,,,,,,"Paul Blickle, Robert Gast, Nicol√°s Pablo Grone, Andreas Loos, Axel Rudolph, Julius Tr√∂ger, Benja Zehr","Robert Gast is an astrophysicist turned journalist, he is the space reporter of ZEIT ONLINE.

We used satellite imagery to pinpoint the areas with the hottest land surface temperatures across 17 Canadian metropolitan areas. Then, we overlayed the temperatures with the Canadian census data, showing that immigrants and people with low income are most likely to live in the hottest urban areas. As one expert told us, ""this is evidence that there is injustice in who will be more vulnerable to climate change.""","Altogether, this series garnered more than 700,000 page views. In ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs who lives in your city‚Äôs worst heat islands‚Äô, almost every reader typed in their postal code to get information about their neighbourhood. They also interacted with the chart arrows three times on average. User engagement was well above average for all pieces in the series. On top of the stories, we also published all of our analysis data and code, allowing anyone to review our work and reuse it. Shiab was contacted by the University of Calgary (Canada), McMaster University (Canada), Laval University (Canada), UQAM (Canada), the University of Waterloo (Canada), the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (UK), and Data journalisme Paris (France) to talk about the project.","First, we had to answer the question: Where are Canada‚Äôs urban heat islands and who lives in them?

To do this, senior data producer Na√´l Shiab and data scientist Isabelle Bouchard used satellite imagery to estimate land surface temperature in Canada‚Äôs biggest metropolitan areas. Land surface temperatures in metropolitan areas were estimated using Landsat 8 imagery. Three cloud-free images were selected for each metropolitan area from the summer months. The land surface temperature of each pixel was then calculated and averaged.

The project was looking at urban heat. So anything that didn‚Äôt fit that definition needed to be excluded. Natural Resources Canada‚Äôs 2015 land cover data was used to crop out lakes, rivers, fields and other non-urban areas. 

Various factors (highly reflective surface material, residual cloud, measurement errors, etc.) can create very high or very low land surface temperature. These outliers were also excluded for each metropolitan area.

The final stage involved overlaying Canadian census information. Because the 2021 census was not yet out, the analysis was based on 2016 data. Dissemination areas were used to ensure the smallest geographic unit of aggregation for variables like income and immigration status publicly available.

These steps were done with the R programming language.

For the dataviz, we used ThreeJS and custom shaders to create a high-performance visualization with more than 28,000 animated dots.","Reporter Jaela Bernstien also worked with the HealthyDesign.City program out of the University of Toronto‚Äôs Dalla Lana School of Public Health to access then-unpublished maps that used census data and information about the way cities are built to illustrate where the most vulnerable populations live. 

Using this data allowed us to expand the project to look at access to shade and pinpoint neighbourhoods that would best tell the stories of those living in extreme heat.

The series was published in July 2022 in English and French. It combined data-driven storytelling, user personalization, illustrative and photojournalism techniques to engage audiences on topics from the national implications of urban heat to stories of those in sweltering apartments without AC.

The data also enhanced our ability to engage readers. In ‚ÄòHere's who lives in your city's worst heat islands,‚Äô users can see how their neighbourhood compares to overall trends, before jumping into city and then national findings.

In 'Sweltering cities' and 'Cooling canopy,' mapping from HeathyDesign.City allowed us to explore areas of Vancouver and Montreal and visualize the difference between neighbourhood tree cover and, with it, access to cooling shade.","CBC/Radio-Canada wanted to show Canadians the growing dangers and existing inequalities when it comes to urban heat.

We found that, in the space of a decade, corporate landlords had gone from owning nearly zero houses in North Carolina to owning more than 40,000. In Charlotte, these companies own one out of every four rental homes, putting pressure on would-be homeowners and tenants alike.

Our reporting revealed a business model designed to squeeze every drop of profit out of renters. And we demonstrated how both federal policy and state pension investments fueled the industry‚Äôs rise.","Until our project, there had never been an accurate count ‚Äì much less precise geospatial data ‚Äì on corporate ownership of single-family housing in any U.S. state.

Months of tedious data work allowed reporters to lift this veil of obscurity and answer critical questions for the first time, revealing stories about the single-family rental industry‚Äôs growth, its impact and the expanding number of people affected by it.

David Szakonyi, an assistant professor at George Washington University and co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Data Collective who reviewed our findings, called the project the ‚Äúbest exercise I‚Äôve ever seen trying to identify properties owned by large institutional investments.‚Äù

Our reporting prompted swift reaction. A virtual town hall to answer reader questions attracted hundreds of live viewers. Raleigh‚Äôs mayor pro-tem [called for action](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article261036377.html) from the city council. Mecklenburg County officials [pledged half a million dollars](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article261634477.html) to study the problem and [pushed for federal action](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article264692029.html). Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., [entered our investigation into the Congressional record](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article261378217.html) and announced that she was authoring related legislation. A national watchdog group cited our work [in a call](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article268767412.html) to end state pension fund investments in the largest corporate landlord‚Äôs major private equity backer.

Because we published [our data and methodology](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/security_for_sale), as well as [a toolkit for reporters](https://mcclatchy-southeast.github.io/sfr-toolkit/), newsrooms around the country could uncover the scale of corporate landlords in their backyards. Our work aided and inspired new and in-progress reporting in [California](https://www.sfchronicle.com/about/newsroomnews/article/Year-long-Chronicle-data-project-reveals-who-owns-17453051.php), [Kentucky](https://www.leoweekly.com/2022/08/a-corporate-landlords-takeover-spotlights-racial-inequities-and-displacement-fears-in-west-louisville/) and [New Jersey](https://www.app.com/in-depth/news/local/how-we-live/2022/08/25/nj-real-estate-housing-market-prices-investors-llc-newark-asbury-park/9793039002/); and Law360 used our toolkit [in a six-part series in Arizona](https://www.law360.com/articles/1541888?scroll=1&related=1).

Our reporting also prompted researchers to further study the impact of corporate landlords. Two, from Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, are studying the rise of institutional investors in rental housing, and they‚Äôre basing their research in Charlotte largely because of what we revealed there.","Although there are just a handful of national corporations buying on a large scale across the state, they use a myriad of subsidiaries and holding companies to conduct business. There's also variation ‚Äì misspellings, mixed punctuation and the like ‚Äì in how these subsidiaries are recorded in property records, making simple counts and matching impossible.

We got around this problem by creating an expansive lookup table of more than 1,600 name variations that link back to just 22 companies.

We first cleaned and manually scoured property records to create a database of parent companies and their most common subsidiaries, which can often be connected by naming convention, corporate mailing address and company officials. We then used that list to create a machine learning model to find other name variations.

Data pulled from eviction proceedings, scraped from utility records and matched against corporate registration data from the nonprofit OpenCorporates was used to add more names.

Almost all subsidiaries identified by the N&O and Observer's reporting were matched ‚Äì either with statistical software or manually ‚Äì to corporate registrations filed with the N.C. Secretary of State's Office to verify their ties to specific parent companies.

We then used statistical software to match the list of investor subsidiaries with property owner names recorded by the North Carolina OneMap, a state project through the N.C. Geographic Information Coordinating Council to collect and publish property parcel information from all 100 counties in the state.

Data scraping, cleaning, matching and analysis was all completed in R and RStudio.

Our two main datasets ‚Äì a lookup table of subsidiaries tied to parent companies and a table of more than 40,000 properties with corporate ownership and geospatial coordinates ‚Äì were published via Git and GitHub alongside a detailed methodology and toolkit for reporters looking to replicate the work.","We started reporting this story in November 2021 after real estate sources told us that corporate landlords were upending Charlotte‚Äôs real estate market. We immediately began hearing stories about how these institutional investors, armed with piles of Wall Street cash, were hoovering up single-family homes, pricing out homebuyers and charging premium rent to tenants. We quickly found that their business model was designed to squeeze every drop of profit out of their houses, often to the detriment of tenants.

What we didn‚Äôt know was the scale of the industry in North Carolina. So we dove into data to identify the biggest corporate landlords and their most common subsidiaries, which we linked using naming conventions, corporate mailing addresses and company officials listed in business formation documents, along with other state filings. We used that list to create a machine learning model to find other name variations. We supplemented our list of subsidiaries and holding companies with data from other sources, including the UNC-Charlotte Urban Institute, MIT researchers, court eviction proceedings, state utility records and the nonprofit OpenCorporates. 

By unraveling the true ownership of hundreds of subsidiaries and holding companies, we identified the largest single-family landlords. With that, we used county-level and statewide property records databases to count how many homes these companies owned across North Carolina, a figure not previously known. We discovered that about 20 corporate landlords owned more than 40,000 houses in North Carolina, including a quarter of the rental homes in the Charlotte area.

Once we knew the scale, we wanted to decipher how these businesses work and affect people in our communities. Our reporting turned up neighborhoods where the companies owned a significant percentage of houses; first-time homebuyers without a hope of competing against Wall Street money; a new financial instrument created by these investment firms to rake in more money; and tenants living in filth because their landlords prioritized profits over people. We captured the industry‚Äôs origin story during the Great Recession by tracking changes on deeds from one local subdivision. That made plain how the federal government unleashed the industry by changing rules to allow investors to scoop up many foreclosed residential properties at one time. 

On May 1, we published the first installment of a three-day series called Security for Sale. In addition to all described above, we reported that local and state officials, despite receiving complaints, do nothing to constrain the industry. In fact, the state pension plan is an enabler, investing millions in the industry‚Äôs rental-backed securities. Other stories explained tenants‚Äô rights and the fragility of local governments‚Äô strategy of depending on homeowners associations to slow the industry‚Äôs growth. 

Transparency was at the core of this project. Upon publication, we made both our methodology and the data powering our investigation public to allow journalists, researchers and the public to investigate corporate homeownership themselves. We‚Äôve also published a detailed toolkit with resources and walkthroughs to help journalists use our data and code to replicate our investigation for their own cities and states.","The rise of the single-family rental industry is not unique to North Carolina.

You‚Äôll find these companies in almost every state, but their spread is concentrated most wherever there‚Äôs a competitive housing or rental market. That makes this story ideal for local reporters, who are best positioned to detail the impacts on their communities on the ground level.

Not all of the lessons learned during the Observer and N&O‚Äôs six months spent tracking and documenting large single-family rental companies in North Carolina will apply to every market. But because this industry has standardized the way it buys and manages homes across the country to increase its profit margins at scale, many techniques will be similar whether you‚Äôre covering Charlotte or Chula Vista, Raleigh or Richmond.

That‚Äôs why we built a toolkit for reporters, funded in part by the Pulitzer Center, for journalists with a variety of skill levels interested in probing the extent of corporate homeownership in their cities, regions and states.

The more we collectively understand how these corporate landlords are buying and operating in our communities, the better positioned we‚Äôll be to ask important questions about their impact on homeownership ‚Äì still the key path to wealth-building for American families.",English,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/topics/security-for-sale/,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article260732907.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article261064492.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article260743117.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article261378217.html,https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/security_for_sale,https://mcclatchy-southeast.github.io/sfr-toolkit/,"Tyler Dukes, Payton Guion, Gordon Rago, Cathy Clabby, Adam Bell, Sohail Al-Jamea, Rachel Handley, David Newcomb, Jeff Siner, Khadejeh Nikouyeh, Melissa Rodriguez, Travis Long, Julia Wall, Alex Slitz, Loumay Alesali, The' Pham and Scott Sharpe","Tyler Dukes is an investigative reporter at The News and Observer.

Em contato com o Minist√©rio da Justi√ßa, a reportagem obteve a confirma√ß√£o de que a opera√ß√£o foi originada pela repercuss√£o do Mapa da √Ågua.","O trabalho foi feito em Google Colab Pro, para conseguir processar os arquivos do Sisagua, sistema de vigil√¢ncia da √°gua do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de, que est√£o em CSV e cada ano tem mais de um milh√£o de linhas ‚Äì cada linha √© um teste feito em algum munic√≠pio do Brasil. No total, de 2018 a 2020, s√£o 5.126.181 linhas. Foram analisadas todas essas linhas para criar as quatro novas colunas de avalia√ß√£o, que indicam se o teste √© Consistente ou Inconsistente e se est√° dentro ou acima do Valor M√°ximo Permitido para uma subst√¢ncia danosa √† sa√∫de.

Esse grande tratamento de dados, que foi feito com a orienta√ß√£o e regras do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de, n√£o pode ser feito em programas normais de planilha, que t√™m uma limita√ß√£o de linhas para processamento. Usamos ent√£o a linguagem de programa√ß√£o Python 3, rodando no Google Colab com aumento de mem√≥ria RAM.

Os scripts em Python usaram bibliotecas voltadas para ci√™ncia de dados e envolveu trabalhos de limpeza de dados, estat√≠stica, an√°lise explorat√≥ria de dados e cruzamento de dados com informa√ß√µes geogr√°ficas do IBGE, para obter nomes oficiais dos munic√≠pios e a latitude e longitude de cada um.
 
Com um algoritmo de mais de 30 passos foi poss√≠vel: processar milh√µes de dados; compreender quais testes da √°gua eram realmente v√°lidos, com padr√µes r√≠gidos; entender quais munic√≠pios de fato t√™m testes v√°lidos, e dentro destes saber quais mostram bons padr√µes de qualidade da √°gua ou abaixo do permitido por √≥rg√£os de sa√∫de p√∫blica; conseguir mostrar onde n√£o havia informa√ß√£o - seja por falta de testes ou por terem um n√∫mero excessivo de medi√ß√µes ineficazes; obter diversas estat√≠sticas sobre munic√≠pios e suas respectivas subst√¢ncias mal√©ficas para sa√∫de, com informa√ß√µes geogr√°ficas, de cada subst√¢ncia e das empresas respons√°veis pelo tratamento de √°gua em cada cidade do pa√≠s.","O Mapa da √Ågua foi a primeira publica√ß√£o jornal√≠stica brasileira que revelou a presen√ßa de subst√¢ncias qu√≠micas na √°gua que sai da torneira em todo o pa√≠s. Ap√≥s mais de um ano de apura√ß√£o, a reportagem entrou em contato com as maiores empresas de abastecimento do pa√≠s, al√©m das cidades onde os dados revelaram as piores viola√ß√µes, n√£o encontramos casos de empresas ou √≥rg√£os de abastecimento que divulguem esses resultados. Sendo assim, chegamos √† conclus√£o de que o Mapa √©, hoje, a √∫nica ferramenta no pa√≠s que d√° acesso a esses dados de forma n√£o codificada.

O maior esfor√ßo da nossa equipe foi o de traduzir uma informa√ß√£o que √© disponibilizada de forma fragmenta e codificada. Para isso, foi preciso a colabora√ß√£o entre jornalistas investigativos, jornalistas de dados, programadores, designers, um professor universit√°rio de qu√≠mica e um t√©cnico em sa√∫de coletiva especialista no banco de dados em quest√£o.

Al√©m disso, como refer√™ncia, usamos classifica√ß√µes dos √≥rg√£os reguladores mais reconhecidos para as subst√¢ncias encontradas na √°gua: Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de (International Agency for Research on Cancer), Uni√£o Europeia, ag√™ncia ambiental dos Estados Unidos (Environmental Protection Agency) e ag√™ncias de regula√ß√£o do Canad√° e da Austr√°lia. Todos os estudos e classifica√ß√µes utilizados est√£o linkados na descri√ß√£o de cada subst√¢ncia, nas p√°ginas dos munic√≠pios.

Depois do extenso trabalho de apura√ß√£o e cruzamento dos dados, houve a etapa para traduzir as informa√ß√µes ao p√∫blico geral. Com um conte√∫do cheio de termos t√©cnicos e cient√≠ficos, a equipe teve a preocupa√ß√£o de construir textos simples e sem jarg√µes. Cada palavra usada nas fichas e nos cabe√ßalhos foi testada entre especialistas e n√£o especialistas para garantir que era tecnicamente correta e compreens√≠vel.

O mapa √© uma vers√£o ampliada e com metodologia aprimorada de um primeiro mapa focado na presen√ßa de agrot√≥xicos na √°gua, publicado em 2019 (por usa vez, a primeira publica√ß√£o dos dados de agrot√≥xicos na √°gua de todo o pa√≠s). Importante ressaltar que os dados do Sisagua passaram a ser publicados no portal de transpar√™ncia do governo federal ap√≥s solicita√ß√£o de nossa equipe em 2018. Mesmo assim, trata-se de um banco complexo e inacess√≠vel para o p√∫blico n√£o especializado.

Al√©m dos dados por munic√≠pio, o Mapa da √Ågua traz ainda uma s√©rie de reportagens que desfiam os resultados e avan√ßam a investiga√ß√£o em diferentes contextos. Revelamos que o maior problema entre as subst√¢ncias qu√≠micas acima do limite s√£o justamente aquelas derivadas do tratamento da √°gua. E descobrimos a sua origem: falta de tratamento do esgoto. Justamente porque a √°gua chega para o tratamento misturada ao esgoto, as empresas usam mais produtos para desinfec√ß√£o, aumentando assim a presen√ßa de subst√¢ncias perigosas √† sa√∫de humana. A p√°gina do mapa traz um menu com as principais descobertas feitas pela nossa equipe, publica√ß√µes que continuam sendo produzidas.","Outros jornalistas podem aprender de diferentes formas com este projeto. A primeira √© utilizando as informa√ß√µes do pr√≥prio Mapa da √Ågua. Eles podem analisar os dados que est√£o na plataforma para produzir novas reportagens com abordagem regionais ou at√© municpais para passar mais informa√ß√µes sobre a qualidade da √°gua para a popula√ß√£o. Al√©m disso, eles podem entender quais s√£o as susbt√¢ncias que s√£o analisadas, seus riscos e at√© onde encontrar essas informa√ß√µes com base cient√≠ficas.
