Malaysia,Macaranga Media Sdn Bhd,Small,Winner,"Data journalism in Malaysia has been elevated to another level since Yao Ha-Law began to lend his talent. To show this contribution, it is important to note that the focus of the work is on environmental issues in a country that has many needs in this area. By using visuals, precision journalism, and other tools, his production gives shape and concreteness to the issues.

An example of an initiative that projects Yao Ha-Law's career is the creation of the Macaranga portal, addressing issues that have not been disclosed by any other communication vehicle. By publishing mainly about forestry data, the work of the award-winning professional is exquisite. With his denunciations, often being the only voice to divulge the subject, Yao Hua-Law managed to produce effective results, preventing the continuation of environmental crimes.",Yao-Hua Law,"I have been a science and environment journalist in Malaysia since 2014. I have mostly reported on ecology and public health for top science magazines, including a narrative feature on snakebite health burden in Indonesia that won the One World Media Award in 2020.

In 2019, Wong Siew Lyn and I co-founded Macaranga, an environmental journalism portal, to fill a gap in in-depth, data-driven and analytical environmental reporting in the country. When our reader interest survey singled out ‘deforestation’ as the top concern, we looked into the matter and started my years-long investigation on forest use and management in Peninsular Malaysia. At the time, no other Malaysian media provided accurate insights on the people or forces that drive forest use. Forestry data was often described as obscure and “confidential”, and the prevalent notion was that reporting on logging projects would trigger the wrath of tycoons, politicians, and royal families.

Our stories for Macaranga, supported by the Pulitzer Center, showed otherwise. I saw how foreign media like Guardian, Bloomberg, and Economist were combining data, satellite imagery, visualisations and storytelling to produce impactful environmental reporting. I attempted a similar approach – though without a freedom of information act in Malaysia, data remain largely limited and scattered. Still, I have been able to sniff out several sources of data (resource centers in government department), learn to analyse satellite images and GIS data in QGIS, use free tools like Flourish, Pinpoint, and others to scrape websites. With Siew Lyn
as editor, we produced stories that were very data-driven and data-supported, and successfully transported readers to the locality using maps and engaging writing.

It might have been a coincidence, but since Macaranga started publishing, other Malaysian media began to include more graphs, maps, and satellite images in their environmental reporting too. Well, we are some of several people training journalists in Malaysia on data journalism and environmental reporting.

In 2022, my stories for Macaranga won Malaysia’s top journalism award – the Malaysian Press Institute Award Gold Prize for Excellence in Environmental Reporting. Macaranga had just turned 3 years old then. But the best news last year was that a company stopped their logging after we reported on them, and the Department of Environment initiated investigation on a royalty-associated company after we exposed that they had broke the law on an oil palm project.","I am the sole reporter and I made almost all of the elements presented in the stories. Wong
Siew Lyn edited all the stories. These projects investigated unsustainable use of forests in Peninsular Malaysia, and exposed systemic failures, illegal activity, or projects that hurt the state and communities but benefit the shareholders.
In ‚ÄúForest Plantations in Reserves‚Äù, I showed that the governments‚Äô forest plantation efforts have destroyed huge tracts of forests without achieving delivering any goals. Forest plantations are monoculture tree farms, and were meant to provide a sustainable timber supply. But I showed that governments only approved plantations inside reserves, and that two-thirds of the 185,000 ha cleared for plantations had been abandoned. Furthermore, genuine planters are struggling with their businesses and refuse to harvest timber as scheduled. 
I analysed more than 40 years of forest plantation documents ‚Äì government reports, conference papers, manuals, and scientific studies. I sought maps to check if and where plantations were destroying good forests. I combed through company financial statements and EIA reports of projects. I persuaded loggers and planters to explain the specifics of their projects; got government officers to confess that their data fails to reflect reality; and spoke with communities affected by forest plantations.
The work required data that is distributed without clear organisation across several government agencies. I had to go to these agencies, daily for weeks to comb their shelves. To convince loggers and planters, I spent days roaming in town. 
A month before my publication, the government suddenly announced a halt on new forest plantation projects. My findings were used in a debate in state legislative assembly. And in the year after publication, as forest plantations hit the news often, journalists and policymakers refer to my stories for background. 
For ‚ÄúCutting Chini-Bera Forests‚Ä¶‚Äù, I revealed how the state government and Department of Environment have approved an oil palm project doomed to fail. That‚Äôs because the project had and will clear natural forests, which disqualifies it from mandatory sustainability certification in Malaysia. The forests there houses tigers, elephants, and hornbills. The site also houses two indigenous villages, some of whom claim they were tricked by the developer into signing letters of consent. 
Digging into company documents and property ownership, I showed that the developer‚Äôs shareholder include royalty and a major Thai conglomerate that brands itself as a tiger defender in Thailand. I made accurate maps and gathered satellite images of the deforestation, and used the evidence to prod Malaysian oil palm regulators into responding: they denounced the project. 
After publication, the developer didn‚Äôt exercise their rights to start logging. A major conservation group suspended its partnership with the Thai conglomerate. And lawyers for the indigenous villagers are using my stories and data to build their court case. 
In the third project, ‚ÄúDrains Dug, Trees Cut, Now Let‚Äôs it Approved‚Äù, I exposed a developer for clearing forests and planting oil palm before it even submitted the mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA). This was a risky story to report on because the Sultan of the state and his family own the developer and the land. The evidence and data I present must be extra solid.
I extracted location, names, and dates of legal procedures out of the project‚Äôs EIA report. I used satellite images to identify progress of deforestation. Then I used a drone to snap images of the development. But the drone limited range meant I had to enter the plantations, posing as a birder, to get exact coordinates of the site‚Äôs border and see the palm saplings planted. I also spoke with workers and locals.
The story prompted the Department of Environment to investigate the developer.",English,https://www.macaranga.org/forest-plantations-in-reserves-quick-to-cut-slow-to-grow/,https://www.macaranga.org/cutting-the-chini-bera-forests-for-oil-palm-that-cannot-sell/,https://www.macaranga.org/drains-dug-trees-cut-now-get-it-approved-aa-sawit-johor/,,,,,,,
Brazil,"The Intercept Brasil, Rede Interação, Revista Piauí, Sumaúma Jornal, Repórter Brasil/Unearthed",Small,Shortlist,,Rodolfo Almeida,"My name is Rodolfo Almeida, I'm a visual journalist, and I have been working at the intersection of journalism, visual narratives and data in Brazil for the last 8 years, and data journalism has shaped my understanding of the world and the ways in which we can act upon it.

My journalism carrer started with an internship working with video stories at Estadão, Brazil’s second biggest newspaper, which introduced me to the power of visual media in telling the stories of our time. This understanding was further developed when I worked at Nexo Jornal, an explanatory journalism outlet, as an infographics reporter. There, I was mentored by amazing professionals such as Simon Ducroquet and Daniel Mariani, and discovered a passion for finding the most simple yet profond visual metaphor for a certain story – a goal I aim at to this day. 

With time, the needs of that job shifted from more classic illustrated infographic work to more data visualization and analysis – and I accompanied that shift and began studying statistics, visual perception and languages such as R, visualization tools and concepts. I'm very greatful for the recognition my work has received in the past years from the likes of Malofiej, SND ÑH, Biennale di Venezia and more.

Since then, it's been a wild ride. I've went to work with other outlets and companies and in January 2022 finally decided to give the freelance lifestyle a shot. In the last year I've worked on 18 different projects for 15 clients – mostly journalism outlets, collaborating with diverse teams of reporters and data scientists on new and original stories. I'm proud of having worked with publications and institutions such as The Intercept, Greenpeace/Unearthed, Revista Piauí, the Climate and Land Use Alliance, and more.

With an educational background on journalism and no formal education on design, coding or data, I also felt the need to go deeper on my understanding of visual representations of the world and how they can inform our actions and generate impact on our lives. So, in 2021, I started a Master's degree in Design at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with orientation by the incredible professor Doris Kosminsky.

My line of research coincided with the subject matter I've been devoting most of my attention, worries and work towards: the climate. In Kosminsky's lab, I've been studying how climate phenomena are currently represented in data visualization and looking in areas as diverse as anthropology, design and philosophy for new and different ideas on how to understand and visualize that which is, by nature, invisible. As part of this academic endeavour, I've given talks in events such as IEEEVIS and CIDI, and published some of my findings in scientific journals.

I personally believe that journalism is a job deeply connected to everyone and everything that surrounds it and, in that sense, that the scientific research process can play a very important part in furthering our journalistic endeavours and the solutions we provide to problems – it sure has definitely deepened my understanding of the world and my journalistic work.

With this portfolio I'm presenting I hope to showcase a data journalism practice in tune with the problems of our time and oriented towards finding new solutions that are simple to understand, but complex to develop. I'm deeply commited to achieving a greater understanding of the world through journalism and to do meaningful and impactful work, and I'm greatful and appreciative of all the talented colleagues I've worked with.","**Additional information from the applicant:**

I've submitted seven projects as part of my portfolio. In five of them I'm credited either on the byline, or footer, or below the graphic pieces. They are:

1. Amazon Under Siege (The Intercept Brasil) - cited below graphics
Contributed only with the charts and animated maps. The Intercept's team had already obtained and pre-analyzed the data. They briefed me on the discussion and invited me to come up with the visualizations.

2. Cities & the Climate (Rede Interação) - cited in footer notes
Contributed with almost every facet of the project. Rede Interação had no expertise in infographics or printed publications. I was called in to both research the content, write it and edit it as well as come up with layout, composition, visualization, and illustrations. The only parts I wasn't involved in were the translations to other languages, and the workshops with local communities, which were held in person and helped shape the publication.

3. Cattle Laundering (Revista Piauí) - cited in footer notes
Contributed only with static charts, header illustration, video and storytelling ideas. The video was the main piece I worked on. Piauí's team had already done most of the reporting, but had trouble coming up with an intuitive and engaging way to convey the data they obtained. I suggested a video as a storytelling device and got to work with the editors on a script, motion graphics and sound design. The reporters recorded the narration for the video, and other interesting pieces of information were visualized as static charts.

4. Yanomami under attack (Sumaúma Jornal) - cited in footer notes
Contributed only with static charts, data analysis and animated maps. The Sumaúma team contacted me before visiting the Yanomami territory and asked me to come up with charts detailing the impact on Yanomami women's health. Soon after, they obtained data from local leadership and I analyzed and wrangled the data and proposed these sets of graphic pieces.

5. Deforestation in the meat business in Brazil (Repórter Brasil/Unearthed) - cited below graphics
Contributed only with static charts and data analysis. The Greenpeace team was working with Repórter Brasil in following the trail of illegal cattle in the Amazon. The bulk of the data work was done by Reporter Brasil's team, which resulted in a fairly large dataset that needed some analysis in search for relevant aspects to be visualized. That's where I conducted most of my work.

The other two projects don't seem to cite my name anywhere. They are:

1. The radicalization of Jovem Pan (Revista Piauí)
Contributed with data analysis, static charts, video research and video editing. The team behind Novelo Data invited me to help them analyze and visualize a large dataset for Revista Piauí. They managed to scrape from YouTube the transcriptions for every episode of Pingos Nos Is, which is Jovem Pan's most prestiged news show and, with so much data available, had a hard time coming up with insights from it and finding ways to visualize it. I proposed some analysis questions, and got to working with the data. This project was a part of a larger investigation conducted by Revista Piauí on Jovem Pan's history, with which I had no involvement. The reporting team occasionally requested some topics to be explored on the data side, and I worked on it alongside Novelo's team. I developed some interactive charts as well which didn't end up on the final piece due to CMS limitations. Midway through the work we had the idea of producing a video montage. I then sketched out a script with the general ideas, and partially watched 100+ episodes of Pingos Nos Is in search of footage. My involvement with the project can be corroborated by Guilherme Felitti (guilherme@novelo.io), Novelo Data's founder, and main data scientist on this piece.

2. The Connection (Revista Piauí)
Contributed only with illustrations, static and animated maps and charts. The reporting was already well advanced with Piauí and OCCRP teams following the trail of yellow Ipê. They had obtained a large amount of geographical and transactional data and needed to present it in a compelling way. I went through their dataset trying to reconstruct the routes and visualize them in maps. My involvement with the project can be corroborated by Allan de Abreu (allandeabreu@revistapiaui.com.br), the main reporter for this piece.

**The original project details are as follows:**

Amazon Under Siege (The Intercept Brasil)
This feature examines the rise in the numbers of shooting clubs in the Amazon and their effects on the neighbouring indigenous lands and other vulnerable communities. For this project, I worked to visualize the original data obtained by The Intercept team in engaging ways, and used static and animated maps and charts. This project was specially important in the context of the 2022 brazilian elections.

Cities & the Climate (Rede Interação)
This large-scale infographic was comissioned by the NGO Rede Interação and produced with input from the communities of Santarém, Pará. It illustrates how urban life relates to climate change and many of the feedback loops involved in these interactions. I was responsible for research, writing, designing, mapping and illustrating the piece. It was distributed freely at Amazon cities and online, in three languages, and informed citizens of the north region of Brazil.

Cattle Laundering (Revista Piauí)
Part of a larger investigative initiative made in collaboration with OCCRP, CCCA and Fiquem Sabendo, this piece for Piauí details how cattle laundering works in the Amazon and how ingrained it is in the meat business in Brazil. I produced static charts and maps and an animated video detailing the process and it's effects. This project shed a light on a repeating pattern on the region.

The radicalization of Jovem Pan (Revista Piauí)
This visual analysis produced for Piauí with Novelo Data's team illustrates how one of Brazil's biggest TV outlets became a disseminator of Bolsonaro's ideology. For this piece I watched hundreds of programs to piece together a video montage detailing how the channel's positioning changed over time and how it fit with Bolsonaro's agenda. I also produced static charts with data processed by Novelo Data's team from YouTube transcriptions.

The Connection (Revista Piauí)
In this piece, I collaborated with charts, illustrations, and maps reporters which reconstructed the route of a batch of yellow ipê wood illegally extracted from the Brazilian state of Pará to a store in New York. Made in collaboration with OCCRP and CCCA, the piece revealed a series of irregularities and corrupt practices along the route that helped to “launder” the endangered wood. The movement of the ipê batch also raised suspicions among Brazilian customs officials, but a series of decisions by the then-Minister of the Environment undermined any chance of investigating the sale. That same minister had already faced scrutiny by the Federal Police for facilitating the international smuggling of timber from the Amazon. Shortly thereafter, he resigned.

Yanomami under attack (Sumaúma Jornal)
The Yanomami land is the largest indigenous territory in Brazil and also one of the main targets of illegal miners bringing violence and destruction to the region. Sumaúma obtained data on these impacts and visited the territory in loco, providing me with first-hand reporting on the situation, and images which helped me produce the animated and static maps and charts in the piece.

Deforestation in the meat business in Brazil (Repórter Brasil/Unearthed)
This collaborative investigation from Unearthed, Greenpeace and Repórter Brasil revealed how Brazil's biggest meat company bought almost 9,000 cattle from one of the biggest deforesters in the country, leading the company to admit, for the first time in its history, to malfeasance. I collaborated with maps, charts and data analysis.",Portuguese,https://theintercept.com/2022/11/09/sob-bolsonaro-clubes-de-tiro-explodem-em-areas-de-conflito-da-amazonia-legal/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McnP6_AHOG0PsQnsV-efKcLiabPdv6Lo/view?fbclid=IwAR0O95mnud6RkbJLhxC75_AR9YrCXd3cKq1-Gum9a6_Hf1uRoA7hhtzjF1w,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/materia/lavagem-da-boiada/,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/radicalizacao-da-jovem-pan-uma-analise-visual/,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/materia/a-conexao-2/,https://sumauma.com/por-que-os-garimpeiros-comem-as-vaginas-das-mulheres-yanomami/,https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2022/11/jbs-admite-ter-comprado-quase-9-mil-bois-ilegais-do-maior-desmatador-do-pais/,,,
United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,,Sondre Ulvund Solstad,"You judges have a tough job. I am sure you must have many strong candidates - I can only imagine the strong submissions you must get. If you were to pick this one, my guess would however be it is for one of the following reasons:

1. These projects suggest novel and often inspiring ways to approach a difficult subject - war and its consequences.
2. They are often very original: from training a machine learning algorithm to read twitter to using over 200 years worth of data to look at conquest
3. Some of the projects are of a different flavour than most data journalism: the story being not the data itself, but what insights you can derive from it - often via rigorous statistical modelling.
4. The portfolio shows a willingness to challenge readers: one attempts (and, I dare say, succeeds) at showing how knowing facts about statistical distributions can be cool (because they show that some countries actively faked covid data).
5. The projects show ambition: from using machine learning to model how the war might lead to more or less political unrest around the world (through price hikes in fuel and food, and more), to pioneering a new way to measure military spending (a ""military PPP"").

To give a bit of background about me: I started working as a journalist in 2020, just before the pandemic began. Before that, I was at Princeton University doing a PhD, and before that, at New York University doing a BA. And before that, I spent a year as a conscript - not too far from the Russian border - in the Medic Battalion of the Norwegian Army. As a journalist, I am probably best known for being the person behind ""the pandemic's true death toll"" - the project which first estimated how many really died due to the pandemic via excess deaths. In addition to my own work as a journalist, I have in the past year also intermittently acted as data editor at The Economist. 

Beyond individual projects, I strive to make data journalism use more of the cutting edge methods found in social science and machine learning, and to make the field more transparent by sharing my code and data whenever I can, as well as helping the field grow through mentoring, presentations (of which I have done many in the past year - including some in person!), and by building bridges with academia (here hope to leverage my nomination to the Institute for Quantitative Social Science). 

Thank you for reading!","My portfolio submission shows my work on the Russia-Ukraine war and its consequences. The goal is to show some of the breadth of what I’ve produced on the subject in the past year. In addition to stories about how the war affects Ukraine and the rest of the world, I’ve tried to include stories of how the war is changing Russia. I’ve also included an article suggesting how hard it is to cover the country as a data journalist - providing statistical evidence that within it, even covid death statistics may have been actively faked. 

To usefully highlight some challenges I encountered along the way: 

“Russians in every major city and region call for #nowar” includes data from public profiles on Instagram. Instagram does not provide this to journalists, and have taken steps to make obtaining it via computer very difficult. Getting this data was therefore very, very, time-consuming.

“Russia is swaying Twitter users outside the West to its side” uses a machine learning algorithm to detect pro-Ukraine, neutral, and pro-Russia sentiment. Such an algorithm did not exist when I started the project, so I had to make and validate one myself. This involved manually reading and coding thousands of tweets to create training data. 

“Vladimir Putin is dragging the world back to a bloodier time” begins with a map showing the approximate location of all wars on the planet since 1816. No dataset of these locations existed either - so I had to find them through other data and historical research. 

In terms of metrics, I am not sure what is expected or what I’m allowed to say on my end. However, I can confidently say that all these articles were widely read: and some were among the most popular articles we have published all year. Moreover, the article “Costly food and energy are fostering global unrest” resulted in massive policy engagement. This included “a high-level discussion” at the United Nations’ headquarters (they told me I could not be more specific), which centred on how the UN could use the methods it pioneered in its work and planning. 

I am the author of all these projects, doing the data collection, modelling, writing, and reporting. All were solo-authored except three: Daniella Raz collaborated with me on ""How the war in Ukraine compares to other refugee crises"", Adam Roberts on “Vladimir Putin is dragging the world back to a bloodier time”, and “Costly food and energy are fostering global unrest” was the work of many hands - I did the data journalism sections, and Robert Guest, Joanna Lillis, Charlotte McCann, Lena Schipper, Mitra Taj, Liam Taylor, Namini Wijedasa, Piotr Zalewski contributed the rest.

Germany,Der Tagesspiegel,Big,Shortlist,,Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab,"Actually, it all started over a beer in a pub. That's where the idea for the Radmesser project was born in 2018. At the time, we used sensors to measure how closely cyclists were being overtaken by motorists. It was to become the Innovation Lab's first project. In January 2019, the team was officially founded. Four years have passed since then. Four became eight team members. Now, three journalists, four programmers and one designer work in the Lab. The projects are more professional, technically better and reach a much larger audience. 

Especially in 2022, the team has proven how outstanding it has become. Our portfolio shows a variety of topics and data visualizations, quite a few of them are live graphics. 

How the ideas come about varies greatly. Of course, as the data team of a daily newspaper, we care about current issues. At the same time, we want to develop our own spin on these topics as much as possible. We succeed in doing this by using special forms of presentation, but also by using different data sources or machine learning for analysis. To get even better access to data, we cooperate with universities and startups. Next to that, we also take part in internationally investigations. And in contrast to other media, we do most research in our Lab team in-house. Precise work and factchecking always have priority. Technically, we are oriented at the fast-faced best practice of international teams. We use Svelte, D3 and prerendering technology. 

Of course, we are not only technically inspired by other media - exciting links to stories with exciting forms of presentation also end up in the team channel as well as new data sets. What is important to us: If we use another medium as inspiration, this is of course indicated. 

After just a few years, the Innovation Lab has become an established data team in Germany. We are delighted if we are considered for the award.","The Innovation Lab's portfolio primarily includes dataviz and visual stories on various topics – from interactive calculators to scrollytelling to live graphics. A quick overview on the stories we handed in: 

For our YouTube and dataviz series „Papaya and Fries“, which was about migrant kitchen and climate change, we built an interactive climate impact calculator for cooking. This can be used to calculate exactly how much CO2 a dish consumes. The data comes from the API of the startup Eaternity, which deals with CO2 balancing. 

An animated scrollytelling with the most important foodstuff furthermore made possible to quickly compare the values and understand, why for example chicken can be much more climatefriendly than many vegetarian aliments made from milk – or, why vegan produce will always be more climate friendly, even if imported. 

In our live article on the Ukraine war, the map shows the course of the war, most current research by media all over the world as well as the locations of significant fighting and tropu movements. It is updated daily. Other graphics in the article data such as support payments to Ukraine, refugees and air strikes. Per month the article gets an average of more than 500.000 clicks. It is among the most successful published pieces. 

The war in Ukraine showed in sad clarity how dependent Germany is on Russian gas. The Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab has therefore built a gas simulator in exchange with scientists, where everyone can try out for themselves how different measures and decisions could interact when the discussion about them was most vibrant last summer. 

Because fake videos are used for disinformation in the Ukraine war, we show how easy it is to make such videos with our own Deep fake. And where the limitations are. 

The „Temperature Monitor„ is also a live graphic and is intended to give a rough impression of how ""normal"" the weather is right now. Daily weather data and forecasts come directly from German Weather Service APIs. With a methodologically very transparent display it shows how – over time – a dramatic climatic trend is created from weather fluctuations. 

The consequences of climate change could be observed especially well in the summer of 2022. In 2022, many rivers had too little water. We use graphics based on water height measurements and satellite images to show how serious the situation is. 

With visual formats we tell the story of the nely started oil production in Uganda from the beginning – using 3D maps; data sets and satellite images around the logistical large-scale operation and the ecological risks. 

Regularly, we use data to work locally and map neighborhoods - for example, with the green space map. It shows which neighborhoods have particularly poor environmental factors. Readers could explore their neighborhoods. The map was our most successful subscription piece. 

In addition to current topics, the Innovation Lab is part of the European Cities Investigative Journalism Accelerator, in which it leads the data management and dataviz for the whole network of 12 European media organisations. It's a network of European media dedicated to researching common challenges facing major European cities and countries. In focus so far is mainly housing. The research on Student Housing is a part of this.","English, German",https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/co2-bilanz-von-essen-der-klimarechner-fuer-deine-kueche/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/wie-klimaschaedlich-sind-beliebte-lebensmittel/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/wie-weit-sind-die-soldaten-aktuelle-karte-der-russischen-invasion-in-der-ukraine/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/lieferstopp-rechner-reicht-das-gas-im-winter-trotz-importstopp-aus-russland/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/real-deep-fake-giffey-antwortet-klitschko/index.html,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/temperaturmonitor-wetter-vs-klima-sind-die-temperaturen-in-deutschland-gerade-normal/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/gruenflaechen-laerm-luftverschmutzung-wie-lebenswert-ist-mein-kiez-in-berlin/index.html,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/pegelstaende-auf-rekordtief-europas-fluesse-trocknen-aus/index.html,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/worlds-longest-heated-pipeline-oil-wells-in-the-national-park/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/studentenwohnheime-im-visier-der-investoren-das-geschaeft-mit-den-studierenden/
United States,"Armando Info, El País, Earthrise Media, The Intercept Brasil, The New York Times, Pulitzer Center´s Rainforest Investigations Network",Big,Shortlist,,Airstrips of Destruction in Brazil and Venezuela by the Pulitzer Center´s Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN) -,"I write this letter on behalf of an alliance of journalists and outlets that collaborated to reveal the criminal infrastructure fueling the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Their stories were published by Armando Info, El País, The New York Times and The Intercept Brasil – a collaboration coordinated by the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN).

The RIN was launched in 2020 with the goal of promoting collaborative investigations to unveil the causes of environmental destruction in the Amazon, Congo Basin and Southeast Asia. As the editor of RIN, I have worked with some of the most talented investigative journalists of our time and have been inspired by their embrace of teamwork and collaboration. 

The project I am submitting represents an important breakthrough because of its innovative methodology to prove a crucial, underreported issue: the connection between criminality and deforestation in the Amazon. Brazil and Venezuela share a sad history of land invasions, violence against Indigenous people, and pollution. A great part of this is caused by the rush for minerals, especially gold.

The investigation broke new ground as the first journalistic endeavor to use artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to map mines and runways in a tropical rainforest. These airstrips are the most blatant element of the growing illegal economy in the Venezuelan and the Brazilian Amazon. Driven by the high profits from mining and drug trafficking, clandestine groups, such as militias and guerrillas, conquer territories by tearing up the forest to allow them to advance into more remote regions. Many of these areas are Indigenous territories and represent the last barriers to the total destruction of the planet’s largest tropical rainforest.

Bringing together journalists from local and global media organizations with civic technologists required diligence and sensitivity given the different languages, cultures, and audiences. The dedicated team from the Rainforest Investigations Network had to manage the expectations, workflows, and dynamics among these partners through countless meetings, one-on-one conversations, and a customized collaborative platform called Confluence. 

Through a collaboration with Earthrise Media, a non-governmental organization that uses geospatial data in journalistic investigations, the team developed a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes satellite images to identify the covert runways. In addition to publishing major stories in The New York Times, El País, Armando Info and The Intercept, we made the geospatial data of gold mines and runways detected by the algorithm publicly available and downloadable, to assist other journalists and investigators in their work.

By publishing methodology and data used, we believe the project will have an enduring resonance beyond this first batch of compelling stories. In partnership with Earthrise Media, the Rainforest Investigations Network has transformed the monitoring of airstrips and mining areas in the Amazon into an interactive tool that other journalists as well as civil society can use.

We published a platform called Amazon Mining Watch (AMW), which will continue to update the data and inspire new investigations. AMW has since been featured by journalism publications including the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN), the Online Journalism Blog, and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.

The reports drew immediate global attention. They were republished and quoted in Venezuelan and Brazilian media. Prominent journalists and media organizations in the United States and Europe also highlighted them. An example of the investigation’s lasting impact is the fact that, with the transition of government after Bolsonaro lost reelection in 2022, legislators in the Brazilian parliament are using the number of airstrips as an indicator of the urgency to reverse the destruction in the Amazon. The new minister of the environment, Marina Silva, cited the investigation’s findings in her speeches and positions.","The principal authors AIrstrips of Destruction are Hyury Potter, for The Intercept Brasil, Manuela Andreoni, Blacki Migliozzi, Pablo Robles, Victor Moriyama and Denise Lu, all for The New York Times, and Joseph Poliszuk, María Antonieta Segovia and María de los Ángeles Ramírez, from Armando Info/El Pais. The project was done with the coordinatination of the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network editorial team: Environmental Investigations Editor: Gustavo Faleiros, Executive Editor: Marina Waker Guevara, Data Editor: Kuek Ser Kuang Keng and Reseach Editor: Jelter Meers. Partnership with Earthrise Media developers Caleb Kruse and Edward Boyda. 

The products of this collaboration are 
- 1 multimedia (front page) article published at The New York Times about airstrips in Brazil 
- A series of six articles called ""Corredor Furtivo"" with multimedia elements published simultaneously at El País and Armando Info, about the relation between the airstrips and illegal armed groups in Venezuela
- 1 featured article at the Intercept Brasil about the relation between the airstrips and illegal mining in Brazil
- 1 documentary launched by The Intercept about the life and work of the pilots working in the illegal runaways.
- The website Amazon Mining Watch and GitHub page managed by the Earthrise Media with all the documentation and code for the geospatial analysis

Since its inception, the investigation had the ambition of generating strong stories and groundbreaking data analysis that would serve as a blueprint for other journalists and civil society actors investigating criminal activities in the Amazon.

From their previous reporting, Potter, Poliszuk, Ramírez and Andreoni knew that unregulated landing strips were key to the criminal infrastructure that facilitates gold mining and other illegal activities. But until now no one had been able to systematically research, identify, and map the gold mines and airstrips, in part because of the impenetrable geography of the Amazon.

 As Rainforest Investigations Fellows, the three journalists decided to join forces to combine advanced data analysis and technology with traditional shoe-leather reporting to reveal for the first time the true scope of the problem. The team partnered with Earthrise Media to build a machine-learning algorithm and the public database that underpins the project.

The Amazon’s illegal economy is an extremely dangerous beat. To complement and verify the computational findings, our reporters did extensive field reporting and had to take many safety precautions. They talked to the people affected by illegal mining and to the pilots flying to and from the mines. They visited the different parts of the illegal mining supply chain, from dig sites to clandestine gold shops.

Different parts of the analysis included painstaking manual work to improve the machine learning algorithm and verify the results. Lining up satellite imagery with a computer program also created coding problems and technical delays.

The development of the algorithm consisted of manually selecting information from historical satellite imagery and then using this baseline for programs to find similar patterns in recent images. This machine-learning process allowed the team to scan thousands of high-resolution Sentinel 2 satellite images dating back to 2016, covering an enormous area in the Amazon.

Such a statistical and computational model is known as an artificial neural network. It was trained to look at patches the size of 44 by 44 10-meter pixels, an equivalent of 440m by 440m on the ground. The AI program found roughly 1269 airstrips in the Brazilian Amazon and 47 in Venezuelan Amazon . Many were found by cross-referencing information in Open Street Map, a community-built global map of roads and other infrastructure.","English, Portuguese, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/world/americas/brazil-airstrips-illegal-mining.html,https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-01-30/las-pistas-clandestinas-que-bullen-en-la-selva-venezolana.html,https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/amazonia-pistas-clandestinas-garimpo/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA-Rk_hdl4M,https://amazonminingwatch.org,https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector,,,,
Portugal,Público,Big,Shortlist,,Rui Barros,"Durante os últimos anos como jornalista de dados/journocoder no jornal PÚBLICO fui autor de várias peças, experimentei vários formatos, explorei novas formas de “data storytelling” e construí várias “news applications”.

Jornalista desde 2016, desde cedo demonstrei interesse na forma como os números, as bases de dados e algumas linhas de código podem ajudar a contar histórias com interesse público. Desde 2020 que trabalho exclusivamente em jornalismo de dados, sendo um dos poucos jornalistas em Portugal que se dedica a este ramo.

Como único jornalista de dados na minha redacção, o meu trabalho inclui colaborar com muitos colegas de diferentes áreas, desde a economia à política, mas também pensar e encontrar novas formas de olhar para um problema - e explicá-lo aos nossos leitores. Peças como “Com que programa eleitoral sairia para jantar?” e “Prometómetro” demonstram, por exemplo, como o jornalismo de dados pode ser útil para pensar novos formatos que sirvam o interesse dos leitores e permitam oferecer novas formas de levar a informação ao público. 

Quando não estou a trabalhar em artigos mais longos e com uma forte componente interactiva, participo com os meus colegas de redacção na elaboração de várias notícias que vão da saúde à economia. São exemplos disso peças como “Travão ao alojamento local pode afectar quase 60% do mercado em Portugal” ou “Profissionais de saúde já fizeram 9,9 milhões de horas extras no primeiro semestre deste ano”. Estes dois casos demonstram como tenho procurado aliar o conhecimento de muitos dos meus colegas de redacção nas suas áreas à minha experiência em recolher e analisar dados. São também um exemplo de como o jornalismo de dados encontra novas perspectivas ou histórias dentro de temas recorrentes no espaço mediático.

Um dos meus grandes interesses como jornalista de dados/journocoder passa pela produção de “news applications” e os seus múltiplos propósitos. Um desses casos é, por exemplo, o trabalho “Simulador: com a Euribor a subir, faça as contas à subida da prestação da casa”, o “tracker” do custo de vida ou o trabalho que permitia aos leitores perceber como o aumento do custo dos combustíveis estava a pesar nas suas finanças. Estes trabalhos, baseados em dados, são, na minha opinião, exemplos de como podemos recorrer a números e bases de dados para oferecer aos leitores conteúdos relevantes e personalizados. A capacidade que o jornalismo de dados online tem para criar experiências únicas aos meus leitores continua, depois destes anos todos, a fascinar-me. Tenciono continuar a desenvolver mais trabalhos como estes.

Para além destes trabalhos, este ano explorei também o scrollytelling como estratégia narrativa para contar histórias. Estou convencido que o scrollytelling, quando combina dados e multimédia, tem a capacidade de contar histórias de forma criativa e eficiente, agarrando o leitor através de uma experiência que faz parte do nosso dia-a-dia: o simples scroll.

Ser um dos primeiros jornalistas de dados num país onde estes se podem contar pelos dedos da mão não foi uma tarefa fácil. Devo muito do que sei à comunidade de jornalistas de dados de todo o mundo, que sempre se mostraram disponíveis para partilhar o seu conhecimento. Também por isso, procuro, agora, devolver à comunidade aquilo que me deu. Tenho sido orador no Dataharvest, onde já fiz sessões sobre NLP com R, introdução ao desenvolvimento web e ao desenvolvimento de news applications com Svelte. Em Portugal, encontro-me neste momento a orientar um estágio em jornalismo de dados e preparo-me para leccionar a disciplina de jornalismo visual e de dados numa licenciatura.

Atenciosamente,

Rui Barros","1- [Com que programa eleitoral sairia para jantar?]
Com recurso a NLP (mas também muito trabalho manual) converti os programas eleitorais dos partidos portugueses numa matriz de concordância e discordância para produzir um “tinder clone” que permitia aos leitores conhecer um pouco melhor as propostas dos partidos.

2 - [Prometómetro]
Seleccionamos 150 medidas emblemáticas e relevantes do programa do terceiro executivo liderado por António Costa e, numa base mensal, vamos verificando o estado de cada uma dessas promessas. Fui autor da “news application”, tendo sido responsável pelo seu design, funcionalidades e implementação.

3 - [Travão ao alojamento local pode afectar quase 60% do mercado em Portugal]
Fui responsável pela recolha, via “web scraping”, dos dados do Registo Nacional de Turismo e consequente análise para perceber o possível impacto que um travão ao alojamento local teria no país.

4- [Profissionais de saúde já fizeram 9,9 milhões de horas extras no primeiro semestre deste ano]
Realizei a recolha e análise dos dados a partir do portal da transparência do SNS.

5 - [Simulador: com a Euribor a subir, faça as contas à subida da prestação da casa]

Japan,"Nikkei, Nikkei Asia",Big,Shortlist,,“Cities and Climate Crisis” series from Nikkei’s investigative reporting team,"Nikkei is Japan’s largest financial newspaper company with more than 820,000 paying subscribers for its online edition. A main focus of the investigative reporting team, formed in April 2021, is how global heating is affecting urban life. We gathered reporters who have extensive experience covering natural disasters, science and technology. They conceived the project's theme and framed the overall story.

The “Cities and Climate Crisis” series used multiple data techniques to analyze the reality of the climate crisis looming over densely populated areas. Through the effective use of graphs, images and maps, we examined strategies for protecting cities beyond a century from now.

We reported on how many airports in the world would be below the sea level if it rises by various amounts due to global heating. We mapped how major cities in Japan and abroad would be submerged and how many residents would be affected.

We analyzed the current status of airports and discussed the measures that should be taken to protect them. We also estimated the cost of countermeasures to protect infrastructure. 

In the project “Heat Island”, we looked at the relationship between the incidence of heat strokes in Japanese cities and the urbanization rate - a measure of the paved area covered by asphalt and concrete. 

We also investigated the threat of “megastorms” - rapidly developing low-pressure systems that can cause major disasters.

The projects explain complex processes using easy-to-understand data. We believe our work provides high-quality and useful information.

The projects involved many designers and engineers who worked to create visually appealing graphics. The designers sorted information and improved its appearance, while engineers created prototypes of interactive graphs and maps. The team prioritized giving the projects a consistent appearance, whether viewed on PCs, smartphones or other devices.","Our “Cities and Climate Crisis” series consists of four infographics.

1.Rising seas threaten world’s airports (available in English)

According to a Nikkei analysis of 5,014 airports around the world, 753 (15%) are located less than 10 meters above sea level. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that sea levels will rise by 1 meter by 2100 under a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions remain high. We used this estimate to conduct a simulation that found 35 airports would be below the sea level if it rose by one meter. 

2.‘Zero-meter zones’ expand globally as sea levels rise (available in English)

This project analyzed the impact of sea level rises on coastal cities in various regions, including Tokyo, Japan. The map shows the affected areas according to the degree of sea level rise. We also highlighted the flood control and evacuation measures envisioned for each area.

3.Heat Island: increased risk of heat stroke (Japanese only)

In this project, we addressed the “heat island” phenomenon in Japan: that temperatures are higher in urban areas than elsewhere. The work looked at the impact of temperature rises in major cities, focusing on numbers of heat stroke victims in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.

4.Threat of megastorms (available in English)

With the help of university researchers, we studied the increase of “bomb cyclones”: sudden drops in atmospheric pressure. We used data from the Japan Meteorological Agency to portray rapidly developing bomb cyclones in a three-dimensional time series. The project used recent trends in typhoon paths to show the increase in precipitation associated with the extreme weather.

Social media users responded very positively to the work and its innovative design. In November 2022, we won a Japan Typography Annual award from the Japan Typography Association.","Japanese, English",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-airports/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-airports/,https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-coastal-cities/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-coastal-cities/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/overheating-cities/,https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/cities-and-climate-crisis/threat-of-megastorms/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/threat-of-megastorms/,,,
Romania,Panorama,Small,Shortlist,,Edit Gyenge,"Traditionally, data visualization has been the domain of large newsrooms with large teams of journalists and designers. However, the rise of new technologies and the availability of open-source tools and platforms has made it possible for small and medium newsrooms to create high-quality visualizations with minimal resources and in a timely manner. This democratization of data visualization has enabled smaller newsrooms to compete with larger ones, by allowing them to tell stories that are just as compelling and engaging as those produced by larger organizations.

What I wanted in 2002 was to make data visualization as accessible to a large audience as I can.

2022 was a year of data visualization experiments and innovation, with over 50 infographics and over 5 major data interactive data visualization stories. I was able to try out a lot of new tools and techniques, and it was a great opportunity for me to learn and grow in this field. I used to think that the most important thing in data visualization was making sure the data was represented accurately, but I've learned that there's more to it than just using the right chart types. It's also important to consider the overall message being conveyed and to be creative about how to effectively communicate it. Sometimes, the story being told through the data might require going beyond traditional methods and finding new ways to present the information. You definitely have to keep in mind what will people feel when seeing your data visualization project. By the end of the year, one of my project was shortisted at the Information is Beautiful Awards and this was a huge step towards achieving my goal in 2022: to play a role in the data visualization democratization in my country and to empower and inspire others to use data visualization to tell their own stories and communicate their own insights.

I believe that by creating effective visualizations, we can contribute to the larger body of knowledge in the field and make it easier for others to understand complex data. This is something I strive to accomplish with every data visualization project I undertake.","My portfolio showcases a variety of data visualization projects, including interactive stories and infographics, that I have created with the goal of pushing the boundaries of what data can communicate. I strive to not only present data in an accurate and accessible way but also to find new and creative ways to tell stories and convey insights. 


**Project link 1: The demographic, political and economic power of generations**

A visual representation of the demographic, economic and political power of each generation in Romania, along with the opportunities and challenges they encountered in their lifetimes regarding human rights protection, urbanization, and economic development. This visual story traces back the factors that impacted the country's demographics and the reason why Generation X currently represents the largest age group in Romania. A large number of generation X representatives were born out of ""patriotic duty"". Decree 770 was enacted in 1966 to restrict abortion and contraception and was intended to create a new and large Romanian population. This visual story presents Romania's present political and business scenes and how younger generations fit in such a context, at what level are they represented in companies, and also national and local political assemblies.

**Project link 2: Mapping down Romania's healthcare system**
An interactive data visualization piece of 173 maps and 63 charts that present the country's health infrastructure (hospital, hospital beds, number of doctors) at a microregional level for each of the 41 counties. Also, for each county, there is a visual history of the evolution of the main causes of death in the past 30 years. Ischemic heart disease remains the main cause of death due to the lack of prophylaxis. This project was made in partnership with fellow journalist Claudia Spridon. 

**Project link 3: Fear of failure in Romanian entrepreneurship and why women fear it more than men**
In Romania, the fear of failure is a prevalent issue in the entrepreneurship landscape, with many individuals being hesitant to start their own business ventures. Research has shown that this fear is often greater among women than men. The aim of the project was to uncover the underlying reasons and explanations for why women may be more susceptible to this fear and how it affects their participation in the entrepreneurial field. The story breaks down the subject matter, analyzing various factors .

**Project link 4: Mapping exam results to understand the Romanian educational system**
An interactive data story about the Romanian educational system over the past 12 years. This story focuses on the various reforms and changes that have occurred in the education system during this time period, and how they have impacted the performance of students. The innovation in this particular story is the 3 granular maps representing school level exam results in 2 Romanian counties and the capital city.

**Project link 5: Global raw material supply**
A data visualization that presents the global distribution, across continents and countries, of minerals using the periodic table of elements. There is strong competition among producing countries such as China, Russia, and the US when it comes to minerals that enter international trade.

United States,The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists,Big,Shortlist,,The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),"For nearly a decade data and technology have been a central part of ICIJ’s cross-border investigations. Throughout the years the team has developed tools that have made collaborations around the world possible and at the same time share and explore millions of records securely. In parallel, the organization has made data accessible to journalists in all continents and has driven analyses to help explore systemic global problems.

ICIJ started expanding its data work back in 2013 during the Offshore Leaks project. Since then, the team has grown and worked on development of tools, data analysis and research to address specific journalistic needs. The team has used open-source technologies to make large sets of files explorable and share them securely for projects like the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers and the Pandora Papers.

ICIJ’s tech team developed an open-source research tool known as Datashare that has been used since 2019 for various cross-border investigations. More recently, ICIJ has also developed another open-source tool called Prophecies to help with fact-checking and validation efforts. 

ICIJ believes that data can be a key connector for journalists around the world and makes it accessible to everyone working on a project. By doing so, journalists bring their best local knowledge and help connect the dots across borders. To facilitate this, ICIJ has also used graph databases (Neo4j and Linkurious) as part of the reporting process.

To coordinate its efforts and stay connected, ICIJ and media partners use a communication tool known as the Global I-Hub. This platform was inspired by the experience of the Offshore Leaks collaboration and an idea brought by ICIJ member Giannina Segnini.

ICIJ’s data and research team has used various approaches to address complex data problems. These include the use of programming languages, machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets as well as manual work. The team has worked on data validation, research, data gathering, data structuring, cleaning, analysis and fact-checking. The work has served journalists around the world who have worked together on different projects. It has helped explore topics systematically and driven some reporting efforts.

During its projects, ICIJ has also provided training to help understand how to best use its technologies for research.

For gathering data, journalists around the world have done thousands of freedom of information requests in projects such as the Implant Files, and explored public records. In the case of investigations that started with a leak, connecting the data with public records has been a central part of the work done by the team followed by traditional investigative reporting efforts done across borders.

ICIJ has also developed products to make data accessible to the audience, such as the Offshore Leaks database and the Medical Devices Database. The Offshore Leaks database contains information on more than 810,000 offshore entities from five different leaks.

ICIJ has been inspired by hundreds of partners around the world. Le Monde, Premières Lignes, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Buzzfeed News, The Guardian, have shared files with ICIJ and media partners that have triggered various global collaborations. SVT and Quartz AI Studio, have also contributed with data efforts.

In 2014 ICIJ established its first data unit comprised by three people: Mar Cabra, Matthew Caruana Galizia and Rigoberto Carvajal. The team has expanded since then.

In 2022 the ICIJ team working on data, research, technology and product included: Agustin Armendariz, Whitney Awanayah, Hamish Boland-Rudder, Jelena Cosic, Antonio Cucho Gamboa, Caroline Desprat, Emilia Díaz-Struck, Miguel Fiandor Gutiérrez, Marie Gillier, Jorge González, Karrie Kehoe, Javier Ladrón de Guevara, Soline Ledésert, Carolina Verónica López Cotán, Asraa Mustufa, Miriam Pensack, Delphine Reuter, Pierre Romera, Nicole Sadek, Bruno Thomas, Maxime Vanza Lutonda, Margot Williams.","2022 brought different data challenges to ICIJ. Throughout the year different projects worked in partnership with journalists and media from around the world involved working with different scale data sets as well as data gathering and analysis efforts. Some started with leaks, others with public records. The team also structured data, shared records, and analysis with journalists to help with the reporting process, using different tools and approaches.

Between January and May 2022 ICIJ incorporated data on people and companies behind more than 11,000 offshore companies, foundations, and trusts from the Pandora Papers to ICIJ’s Offshore Leaks Database. To be able to do so, the team conducted checks and validation on the data that was originally extracted from 11.9 million records using a variety of methods including machine learning, programming languages as well as manual extractions. The Offshore Leaks Database now has data on more than 810,000 offshore entities from five different leaks and connects with more than 200 countries and territories.

Together with the publication of the data, ICIJ conducted an analysis on the presence of Russian oligarchs and politicians in the Pandora Papers that was published as part of the Russia Archive project. 

Additionally, between February and December 2022, ICIJ worked on the Ericsson List that revealed that the Swedish-based multinational sought permission from Islamic State terrorists to work in an ISIS-controlled city in Iraq and paid to smuggle equipment into ISIS areas on a route known as the “Speedway.” ICIJ’s data team reviewed all the leaked documents to consolidate details of payments made by Ericsson and what constituted a breach of its own code of conduct to complement on-the-ground reporting. The team also reviewed public data on deferred prosecution agreements of the kind that Ericsson had negotiated while much of the corruption undercovered in Iraq was underway. ICIJ discovered that countries around the world had been adopting the use of such U.S.-style corporate leniency deals even as they had come under increasing criticism in the U.S. itself.

During July 2022 ICIJ, The Guardian and media partners published the Uber Files. The project started with more than 124,000 leaked records. Using Apache Tika, Python, Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel, ICIJ organized information on meetings, reviewed public records on lobbying and declaration of meeting schedules, to investigate how Uber stormed into markets around the world and how it deployed a phalanx of lobbyists to court prominent world leaders to influence legislation and help it avoid taxes. ICIJ had to parse countries’ varying lobbying and meeting-disclosure records, accounting for variations in the type of data available and its quality. It was key to confirm whether scheduled meetings referred to in the records took place or not, for which connecting the data with public records was central.

Datashare, an open-source research platform developed by ICIJ’s tech team was central to allow journalists to search and review the documents securely. As some of the emails were in French, the team developed a feature that converted the text to English. 

Between November and December 2022, ICIJ, ProPublica and media partners published the Shadow Diplomats that identified at least 500 current and former honorary consuls accused of crimes or embroiled in controversies, before, while or after they were appointed, including some caught exploiting their status for personal gain. ICIJ spent months requesting, collating and analyzing data on honorary consuls from all around the world, and created a first-of-its-kind index to analyze the transparency of countries and their honorary consul appointments

United States,Reuters,Big,Shortlist,,Reuters,"Reuters continues to tell their most important stories visually. Our projects follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism, whether that is innovative data gathering techniques, data-driven investigations, satellite journalism, explainer illustrations or immersive presentations.

Regardless of subject matter, project size, or reporting methods, data journalism plays a major role in delivering stories.

**Strong emphasis on project design**
Reuters pays careful consideration to the tone and subject matter as expressed through the design of the story. Reuters strives to forge a visual connection between audience and content before they have read a single word. The design and feel of each piece often reflect the tone and subject matter. This can be seen in across a range of our work. The project looking at the collapse of insects is a strong example of this.

**Making data understandable**
One of our missions is to make complex or difficult data sets easily digestible to tell stories. Design is a key component of making difficult data accessible. For example, our project explaining how Tonga was engulfed by lightning after the massive volcanic eruption combines huge amounts of data with clear explanations and animation to explain why it was one of the largest volcanic lightning events ever recorded.

**Innovation**
The Reuters Graphics team are continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information. One example of this is evident in our coverage of the sediment loss in the Mekong River. The team are constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver our stories too. Take our series of projects on the major volcanic eruption in Tonga, for example, where the explosion cloud was reprojected, animated, and placed over major land masses to show its scale.

**Public service**
Getting timely information around the U.S. midterm elections and putting the mountain of statistics, voting information, and polling data in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. Our live results maps and dashboard were used by other media outlets around the world and read widely online. 

**Breaking news coverage**
When major news breaks, such as natural or unexpected disasters, colleagues from all aspects of the newsroom join forces to work with the graphics desk. Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give the reader everything they need to know about an event in one place. Our project revealing how the Halloween crowd crush unfolded in Seoul, South Korea, is a prime example of this.

**Analyzing and contextualizing the news**
Beyond the real-time response to unfolding news events, the graphics team strives to keep in mind the bigger picture and possible follow-on effects to produce timely stand back pieces that investigate the wider impacts or potential directions of a story. The team’s ongoing coverage of the war in Ukraine is a prime example of this.

Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this. Reuters strives for this balance in every piece of visual journalism we undertake.","**The collapse of insects**
The most diverse group of organisms on the planet are in trouble, with recent research suggesting insect populations are declining at an unprecedented rate. This piece combines data with vivid illustration to explain the importance of insects and why they are in decline. 

**The perfect storm: How Tonga was engulfed by lightning**
This data analysis shows why the volcanic lightning storm from the Tonga eruption was unlike anything on record. Reuters used data from a ground-based global lightning detection network to visualize the lightning activity during the eruption. The immersive animated storytelling helped put this storm into perspective and make this complicated information easy to digest.

**The war in Ukraine**
By early January 2022, the Kremlin had massed some 100,000 troops around Ukraine's borders in a preparation to invade. Reuters used satellite imagery to show the scale of Moscow’s logistical expansion along the border, measured how the Ukrainian defence forces compared to Russia’s military and outlined the likeliest routes Russian troops would take to occupy Ukraine. The project was one of the first to outline the likeliest scenarios for military invasion.

Then came the energy crisis. As tensions between Russia and the West deepened on the borders of Ukraine, Europe and Russia’s long interdependence on one another for energy had become a critical bargaining piece on both sides. Reuters published a data and map based project that clearly quantified Europe’s reliance on Russian gas and oil and the pipeline infrastructure that underpinned the alternatives available to Europe.

Then in the summer, we looked at how control had changed hands through the war. Nearly five months into what Russia had planned as a swift invasion, Ukraine had preserved its sovereignty and pushed back Russian forces in some areas. This report, based on data derived from satellite-images provided by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), as well as Reuters reporting from the ground, captures key moments on the road to the summer's military impasse.

**Stronger, faster, higher**
This data-driven explainer visualizes how North Korea’s missiles are going higher and further. The team turned trajectory data into an interactive 3D animation, walking the reader through one of the record-breaking launches. Further data analysis reveals the progress of Pyongyang’s missile program. 

**Why plants matter**
They are the foundation of life on Earth, providing food, medicine, building materials and clean air but across the world, plant species are disappearing fast. This story takes a closer look at the rate at which we are losing species and why they are harder to assess than mammals. Scientists have assessed the extinction risk of only about 15% of species. 

**Starving the Mekong**
An exclusive data analysis shows how dams in the upper Mekong River are holding back up to 80% of sediment that should flow through the 4,900km-long waterway, starving the delta in Vietnam of nutrient-rich, land stabilizing soil essential for farming. This graphics story brings together data visualization and on-the ground reporting to show how this phenomenon is gradually but irreversibly reshaping the lives of millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the river.

**Why Arctic fires are releasing more carbon than ever**
With climate change raising Arctic temperatures faster than the global average, wildfires are shifting poleward where the flames blaze through boreal forest and tundra and release vast amounts of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich organic soil.

A Reuters analysis found that high-latitude wildfires were responsible for a greater share of total global fire emissions in 2021 than in any year since monitoring began in 2003, releasing nearly a third of last year’s total carbon emissions from wildfires.",English,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/INSECT-APOCALYPSE/egpbykdxjvq/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TONGA-VOLCANO/LIGHTNING/zgpomjdbypd/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/RUSSIA-UKRAINE/dwpkrkwkgvm/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/GAS/gdpzynlxovw/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/CONTROL/gdpzygorxvw/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES/TESTING/byvrllmjmve/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/PLANTS/jnpwyygywpw/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/MEKONG/egpbyyadnvq/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/WILDFIRE-EMISSIONS/zjvqkrwmnvx/,
Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Shortlist,,Stephanie Adeline,"I am a journalist for The Straits Times digital graphics team. Since I joined the team in 2020, I have dedicated my time to understanding large, complicated datasets and presenting them through simple, comprehensible charts, maps and other creative visualisations.

My goal as a journalist is to detangle complex issues and explain them in a way that is accessible to our readers. In 2021, one of my focuses was visualising the urgency of climate action.

Since 2021, one of my areas of focus was visualising the impact of climate change and the urgency of climate action. In 2022, our team continued with the Climate Code Red series with three projects, two of which were led by me.

In July, I published a piece for Earth Overshoot Day. My goal for this piece was to explain the abstract concept of Overshoot Day in the simplest terms possible so that readers don’t feel overwhelmed, while also explaining the urgency that time is running out and we need to act now. This piece was one of our most viewed graphics this year.

Another project that was near and dear to my heart was a deep dive on the fashion supply chain and practices of greenwashing. This was a challenging story because it pushed me creatively to think of visual metaphors and an engaging way to explain a complicated process. After countless virtual meetings with experts and people working on the ground and virtual sketching sessions, we produced an interactive page that featured a stop-motion video and visualisation of the Fashion Transparency Index. This theme of transparency was reflected in the design of the page, including in the data visualisation. 

This year, I was also challenged to take on data projects on new topics that I’m not familiar with. I produced pre and post- analyses of the Malaysia elections, which involved a lot of sifting through a lot of election data, both current and historical. It was an unprecedented election and we were able to gain many insights from data in a relatively short time.

Throughout the year, I have led the team in many quick-turnaround breaking news reports, despite working remotely and being based in a different country than most of the team. This included the Russia-Ukraine war, the football tragedy in Indonesia, the crowd crush in Seoul and the landslide in Malaysia.

Going into my third year working as a data and visuals journalist, I continue to acquire new skills in my toolbelt. I am currently taking my Masters in visual tools with the University of Girona. Through the master’s program, I am advancing my skills in programming, statistics and data analysis. This year, I am hoping to further challenge myself creatively to make data more relatable to readers and to tell data stories with empathy.","1. Earth Overshoot Day: We're living like we have 1.75 Earths: Mankind is consuming way more natural resources than the planet can replenish each year.

United States,ProPublica and Partner Newsrooms,Big,Shortlist,,ProPublica and Partner Newsrooms,"With a team of nearly 150 journalists, ProPublica investigates a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, healthcare, immigration and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to spur real-world impact. Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels. A key element of our model is partnering with other newsrooms - from national nightly news broadcasts to legacy local newspapers to new regional nonprofits. Data journalism has been central to our newsroom from the beginning. In the 15 years since we first published we’ve grown enormously and, as evidenced by this portfolio, the amount and ambition of our data journalism has grown as well.","In 2022 our data journalism uncovered broken systems and policies, holding those in power to account:

* We detected dangerous concentrations of toxins in wild salmon, a staple of tribal diets in the Pacific Northwest, shedding light on the agencies and policies that are responsible for endangering tribal members’ way of life.

* We exposed how school officials exploited a loophole in Illinois law by working with police to fine students for violations like truancy and vaping. Our interactive database allowed parents and students to check how much it was happening in their district. Newsrooms across the state, including at least one high school newspaper, used the data to publish their own stories. Hours after the investigation’s first story was published, the state superintendent told schools to end the practice. 

We named every Fortune 500 company that provided financial support to election-denier members of Congress after Jan 6.

* We showed how for Black families in Phoenix, child welfare investigations are a constant threat. One in three Black children there faced a child welfare investigation over a five-year period. The office of the state’s incoming governor said it had read our work and wanted to take the agency in a new direction. She chose a new director of the state’s CPS department: a Black community advocate whom we had highlighted in our story. 

* We revealed that soldiers in the Army are more likely to be locked up ahead of trial for disobeying an officer or drug offenses than for sexual assault.

* We found that traffic cameras in Chicago disproportionately ticket Black and Latino motorists - a byproduct of the difference in urban design among neighborhoods.

* We tackled economic inequality from multiple angles: continuing our coverage of America’s broken tax system, documenting the scope of a predatory lending industry, and examining the long-lasting economic effects of the Hurricane Katrina rebuilding program.
 
A common thread in our entries this year: most of these projects used data that was difficult to obtain. Sometimes the data we needed didn’t exist; we spent weeks or months painstakingly compiling it ourselves. Our interactive database of roughly 12,000 tickets issued to students in Illinois is based on records requests from more than 500 school districts and police departments. For another project, we got sensitive data only available with an research proposal and approval from an institutional review board. Other times, we spent hours reporting out where to get not just any data, but the right data, and then used persistence, politeness and patience to get access. 

These projects are stellar examples of accountability data journalism, and we are proud to submit them for a Sigma Award.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-us-broke-promise-to-protect-fish-for-tribes,https://projects.propublica.org/illinois-school-police-tickets-fines/,https://www.propublica.org/article/for-black-families-in-phoenix-child-welfare-investigations-are-constant-threat,https://projects.propublica.org/americas-highest-incomes-and-taxes-revealed/,https://www.propublica.org/article/army-sexual-assault-alvarado-pretrial-confinement,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-louisiana-road-home-program-shortchanged-poor-residents,https://www.propublica.org/article/title-lenders-trap-georgia-residents-in-debt,https://projects.propublica.org/fortune-500-company-election-deniers-jan-6/,https://www.propublica.org/article/chicagos-race-neutral-traffic-cameras-ticket-black-and-latino-drivers-the-most,https://www.propublica.org/article/gallup-mckinley-schools-native-student-discipline
United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Shortlist,,The Times and The Sunday Times Data Team,"The Times and The Sunday Times are two of the oldest newsbrands in the world, boasting about 437 years of journalistic history between them. Data has been a feature of our reporting for most of those years: back in 1860, The Sunday Times devoted most of a page to a grim yet fascinating chart from an insurance company, on the ages at which people in Britain were expected to die. 

Data has been part of our journalism for many decades – but in the past three years, it has become crucial to our reporting of the very biggest stories. The breadth of our portfolio bears witness to this, as does the strength of our data team. Now 10-strong, and made up of developers, reporters, designers and talented graduates, we cover everything from contextualising breaking news, to vital investigative journalism. 

We’ve shown that data-led and visual techniques can be turned to any topic. Covid and the Ukraine war have been important focuses for us this year – but the team has used clever and insightful visualisation techniques to explore everything from Eurovision to Formula 1. At the centre of our data journalism is the reader: how we help them to comprehend a topic, understand the truth behind a story, reassure or warn them about the future, or see where they fit into the wider context. This approach pays off: our journalism is frequently among the best-engaged of any other pieces on the site. 

While change at two two-centuries’ old newspapers can be a slow process, The Times and The Sunday Times are gaining a well-deserved reputation for concise, clear and timely data journalism.","Collaboration is key to our work. The team projects below have relied on a network of talented developers working to challenging deadlines, visualisation experts, and some of the best journalists in the country working in every field from health to sport, war reporting to climate science.

Helping our readers contextualise the Ukraine war was a challenge, particularly given unreliable data from both sides. In March we sought to explain why so many Russian soldiers were dying in Ukraine, and suggested it could be down to the size of the populations they were trying to subdue compared to the number of Russian troops. We also used scrollytelling to show how the present rate of attrition – worse than some of the 20th century’s bloodiest wars – was unsustainable. This piece had an average dwell-time of nearly seven-minutes, exceptional for a piece of its length and indicative of how visually engaging our readers found the storytelling.

In our reconstruction piece of the siege of Mariupol, we aimed to walk the reader through what happened, placing them at the location and recreating the destruction of the theatre by bringing together satellite maps, photography from the ground, drone video footage and case studies from those in the city. We used OpenStreetMap to build a 3D building layer of the city, and OSINT techniques to pinpoint key events and photographs.

From war to peace, our data journalism was utilised on a range of different topics in 2022 – including the Eurovision Song Contest. Our anallysis used Spotify’s API to log the attributes behind the most successful Eurovision songs of all time – and give countries a hint as to who might win. We used a combination of React components and Datawrapper charts to present the findings in an innovative and engaging way – including a few Times data team firsts, like what we can only term a “piano” chart. 

Last year was an outlier for a variety of different reasons, not least climate records, shattered in Britain and beyond. Our analysis allowed readers to learn where, why and how the UK recorded its hottest day on record, and what it meant for our warming nation. Readers told us that they loved playing with the interactive map sliders which showed – in no uncertain terms – how recent droughts had turned our countryside yellow. 

We have also used data to track some of the seismic political shifts that are happening in the UK. We used fresh polling data to see whether a United Ireland was indeed a likely prospect, as some forecasters have suggested after Sinn Fein became the largest party in Northern Ireland. Our subsequent work on the topic – including polling on young peoples’ awareness of the Troubles – dominated the Irish news agenda for several weeks afterwards.

Some of our slickest visual work tracked the most unusual topics: our depiction of the changes to F1 cars for the 2022 season involved the creation of a scrollytelling component to animate a 3D model, which has been reused for a variety of different uses since.

Our data journalism has also been used as the centrepiece to a number of key investigations in 2022. We used R to analyse more than 11,000 messages on the social media site Telegram, and found that antivaxxers were directing horrific abuse at health workers. At the end of the year, we turned our attention to the dire state of cancer care in Britain after the pandemic. We found that the average wait for cancer treatment had gone from 47 days in 2019, to 55 – which could make the difference between living or dying – resulting in an agenda-setting front-page story.",English,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/outnumbered-why-are-so-many-russian-troops-being-killed-in-ukraine-hhshp5jcr,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mariupol-documenting-a-medieval-siege-in-the-21st-century-9p7r8m68v,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eurovision-2022-songs-analysis-p5d6gndsp,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/closer-racing-and-more-overtaking-inside-the-2022-car-3g0phg5xc,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/would-a-referendum-deliver-a-united-ireland-vmb78dwvg,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-is-the-uk-so-hot-climate-change-explained-in-maps-and-charts-qjl22c685,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kill-health-workers-antivax-campaigners-demand-in-telegram-chats-mk87kpcsd,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-is-britain-still-lagging-behind-on-cancer-care-02bzp3vg8,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-long-can-the-unions-afford-to-go-on-strike-26rkmdp26,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/america-s-battle-with-gun-violence-in-maps-and-charts-sjl083fcf
Indonesia,Narasi,Small,Shortlist,,Narasi,"Narasi was founded in 2018. It was founded by Najwa Shihab, a popular TV journalist in Indonesia. Our editorial staff consists of less than 35 people (small newsroom). Our reporting platform focuses on video reports.

Since three years ago, the investigation and data division was formed with three personnel: Aqwam F Hanifan (Producer - OSINT researcher), Arbi Sumandoyo (Field producer), Waheb (Video data-journalist)

Investigative reports in platform video using data and OSINT in Indonesia are very rare. We are trying to fill that void. In addition to extensive research, a creative approach needed so public understands the complex data. And we've done it successfully for the last three years. 

Some of our reports become public discussion. Among them dismantling the government's fake Covid-19 data by utilizing a leaked spreadsheet on the Ministry of Health's YouTube channel, exposing the perpetrators of a riot during an anti-government demonstration which turned out to be not a demonstrator by using an open CCTV, dismantling the placement of a new military post in Papua by using photos and videos of soldiers on social media etc.

As one of the countries with the highest internet users in the world, digital data information in Indonesia is quite abundant. That's why we are trying to popularize the use of a combination of traditional journalism with open source methods in various media, NGOs and campuses. 

We often collaborate with campuses, NGOs and other media in dismantling various cases of human rights violations, environmental damage, and disinformation on social media.

Our video-based investigation report requires us to present the clearest evidence possible. This is what makes us sometimes get threats from those who don't like us. Last year, our site was hacked and given a ""shut up or die"" threatening message. In addition, 30 of our staff's WhatsApp and Telegram accounts were hacked. This strong suspicion comes from the government, because the hack coincided with our report alluding to corruption cases within the state police and intelligence services.","1. This report was in collaboration with HRW. During the Covid-19 pandemic, and schools were closed, students were required to attend online school. The Indonesian government required students to use 6 EdTech applications. Using static and dynamic analysis, we found strong evidence that this child user data is being sold by applicators to advertising companies. Ironically, one of the apps selling the data to the ads is owned by the government.
2. We scraped hundreds of keywords selling wildlife on Facebook and found a local big seller who turned out to be affiliated with a Chinese middleman. We found the cage he used to keep the rare animal. We reported this finding to the police, unfortunately the police did not follow up on the findings of the Chinese intermediary. They only arrested the local people who were involved.
3. As the world's largest nickel producer, the Indonesian government has banned raw nickel exports. Nickel can be exported after being processed in a special smelter. We collected hundreds of business documents for nickel companies in Indonesia. The result is that 90 percent of nickel companies in Indonesia are owned by China. The problem is, this Chinese company is not environmentally friendly. We found a large company in Maluku that dumped nickel waste into the open sea. By analyzing satellite imagery combined with photos/videos of residents on social media, we can prove this allegation. This pollution makes it difficult for fishermen to find fish. and the fish also polluted. We collect data on fishermen's activities and fish movements. In conclusion, nickel pollution in the Halmahera Sea is very dangerous because the area is a national fish storage area. 
4. A police general kills his aide. Then he fabricated a case that he wasn't the culprit. One of the tricks was by releasing a CCTV to the public which was used as an alibi that when the murder occurred he was not at the crime scene. By analyzing the sunshade, we proved that the tape was engineered. The video displayed does not match the hours it should be.
5. This report aims to provide a detailed chronology of the Kanjuruhan incident that took place on October 1, 2022. We analyze thousands of videos from public sources and eyewitnesses. Based on our analysis, there were at least 80 projectiles of tear gas fired after football match Arema vs Persebaya ended, causing a loss 135 of lives. Horribly, the spectators were the main targets of the shots by the police. When everyone was trying to get out of the stadium in a state of panic, there was a large crowd at the exit, which exacerbated the situation. The disturbances and horror were caused by the tear gas deployed by the police.
6 We infiltrated and collected thousands of chats on telegram and monkey hater community forums for five months. There they traded sadistic content monkey torture. The monkey was tortured on request: burned, skinned, blended, etc. By analyzing one by one the sadistic content videos as well as a series of digital footprints in the form of social media and online financial transaction accounts from social media that we ""infiltrated"", we were able to track down several perpetrators in this network. This community moves underground in a coordinated manner through various online community platforms. The majority of customers this content come from United States and Europe, they seek supplies of this content from Third World countries. Indonesia is the largest supplier of sadistic content that violates the animal's right to life. We found the perpetrator in Indonesia and managed to drag him to prison.","English, Bahasa",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5AtwMKGc2o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hODangmzhas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyoud99LfRs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH_hzuxxeW8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZYl4Jifzf4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOHRFIhF0Y8,,,,

Se trata de un medio de información generalista, con especial foco en la política, la economía y las finanzas. En su trayectoria, destaca por ser el primer medio español que decidió crear una sección de datos. Desde entonces, ha participado en investigaciones internacionales como los Panama Papers. Desde 2017 también forma parte de la primera red de periodismo de datos europea, la EDJNet.","Presentamos este portfolio de forma conjunta entre la sección de datos, formatos e internacional de El Confidencial. Este año, uno de los retos informativos ha sido cómo contar las cifras de la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania. La falta de información fidedigna en muchos aspectos ha llevado a pensar en nuevas formas de contar el avance del conflicto, con los datos disponibles, pero mateniendo el rigor que caracteriza nuestro trabajo.

El primer reto fue intentar medir el arranque del conflicto a partir de los datos de las bajas. Para ello, nos preguntamos cuántos cuántos rusos estaban muriendo en Ucrania, a solo un mes del inicio del conflicto. Las cifras eran muy diferentes dependiendo de la fuente, por lo que creamos una visualización que permitiera explicar todos los posibles escenarios. Con una estimación cauta, mosotramos cómo el principio de esta guerra estaba siendo ""un desastre al ritmo de 20 afganistanes"". A través de un formato especial, con infografía y vídeos, pusimos en contexto las cifras del comienzo de la guerra en cuanto a las bajas tanto humanas como materiales, en comparación con otros conflictos. 

También al principio del conflicto, contamos cómo el conflicto se planteaba en un contexto de aislamiento de Rusia. Visualizamos en un formato especial qué paíse apoyaban a Putin y cuáles eran los posicionamientos internos de la población rusa. Como se ha hecho en otros medios de comunicación, en El Confidencial tambiénse ha llevado a cabo un gran esfuerzo por contar con mapas la evolución de la invasión.

En mayo, hicimos un repaso de los diez principales datos que explicaban la guerra, con infografías, mapas y vídeos para contar desde la destrucciones de las ciudades hasta los envíos de armamento.

Entre las publicaciones con mapas, destacamos un proyecto en el que dimensionamos a la escala española la invasión de Rusia a Ucrania, para acercar esta información a nuestro lector.",Español,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-03-24/cuantos-soldados-rusoshan-muerto-en-ucrania_3396744/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-03-05/guerra-ucrania-putin-elparia-mas-peligroso-mundo_3385522/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-05-09/una-factura-millonaria-y-la-destruccion-de-un-pais-10-datos-de-la-invasion-rusa-de-ucrania_3420013/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-04-30/mapas-espana-ucraniaguerra-invasion-comparacion_3414873/,,,,,,
Germany,CORRECTIV,Small,Shortlist,,CORRECTIV.Klima,"CORRECTIV.Klima is a small team within the German non-profit investigative newsroom CORRECTIV. For the past year, we’ve covered (ground)water and other climate topics extensively in Germany. Whether it be suing the Government of a federal state to name the biggest commercial groundwater users or tediously collecting and analyzing data with the help of hydrogeologists, we have been adamantly reporting on the fate and well-being of Germany’s most precious resource – and providing local journalists around the country with the tools to do so, too.

At the heart of our research on water is the groundwater atlas. We were able to visualize for the first time how groundwater has developed since 1990. An overview that did not exist until our publications. For the first time, researchers, the public and, above all, those with political responsibility can now see in which regions are threatened by water scarcity.

We do not do this work alone. Collaboration with journalists, especially on the local level, is a key part of how we do our research. Whenever we do a data-driven investigation, we share our results with the over 1,500 local journalists who are part of the CORRECTIV.Lokal network. We do this through writing a “reporting recipe” for each investigation, a sort of how-to guide for covering topics like groundwater or extreme heat. The recipe details what data is available and how to interpret it, as well as possible angles and interesting regions. Oftentimes, the data comes from freedom of information requests or months of scraping and analyzing the disjointed systems maintained individually by Germany’s 16 federal states. We also field questions and consult directly with local reporters who may need help filing follow-up requests. We recently started offering expert-interviews ahead of publication as well. The final step is a joint publication that reaches readers on both the national and local level.

Our goal as a team is to not just produce journalism that holds governments and companies accountable for their impact on the environment, but also to make this reporting accessible to local journalists, who – like in many other news ecosystems around the world – often lack the proper time and resources to delve into complexer data stories. To meet this challenge, we also coordinate regular and free workshops for the local network. After all, change starts at the local level. In 2020, local journalists published over 150 articles in cooperation with the CORRECTIV.Klima team.

In the coming years, we hope to develop ourselves as a regular source for climate coverage for readers and local journalists alike. This means expanding our regular coverage by making use of sources like the Deutsche Wetterdienst, Germany’s national weather service and an expansive provider of monthly and daily climate data. With an eye on the summer months, we are planning to offer a regular data package focused on extreme heat, forest fires and drought on the regional level. At the same time, we also hope to continue to work on longer-term projects where we can dedicate time to collecting and analyzing data that is not easily accessible to the public.

For the first of our publications, “Diese Unternehmen dürfen Wasser auf Jahrzehnte entnehmen”, we collected data on the biggest water users in each federal state – almost all large industrial operations.

As Germany starts to experience more summers ridden by extreme heat, drought and forest fires, the number of local conflicts is growing. This led us to investigate which of those conflicts go to court. We scraped and evaluated roughly 350 proceedings on water conflicts in the Juris legal database, which collects all judgments made available by German courts. Our sample shows a clear trend: In the past ten years, judicial conflicts over water have increased in 11 out of 16 German states compared to the previous ten years.

Our most recent investigation into groundwater took a more scientific approach. Over 10 months, we collected 32 years of data for every groundwater measuring station in Germany. 

The resulting publication was the first Germany-wide analysis of groundwater thus far. We found that during the drought years between 2018 and 2021, half of the over 6,600 evaluated measuring stations reached their lowest level in the last 32-years. In many areas, we have been able to demonstrate extreme trends for which industry and drinking water extraction are primarily responsible.

We also published the Groundwater Atlas, an interactive map that allows users – both readers and local journalists – to explore how groundwater levels have changed in their region, as well as to inspect the trends of individual measuring stations. The biggest challenge of this investigation was collecting and standardizing the data. Each federal state measures its own groundwater – sometimes several times per day, others once per month. The units of measurement also vary from state to state, as well as the coordinate systems used to map the measuring points.

After consulting with multiple hydrogeologists, we analyzed the data by first standardizing it and filtering for quality and completeness. For this step, we used a semi-automated process that highlighted points where water levels changed erratically. For example, if a monitoring well is replaced and the measurements are not recalibrated for the new elevation, it may seem that the water level suddenly rose. We manually reviewed the data for each monitoring station where such jumps were identified and removed the erroneous stations from our analysis.

We then used a monotonic trend analysis to test for long-term increasing or decreasing trends, and categorized the resulting measurements into three categories: strong trend, weak trend, or no trend. All of the data we collected, as well as the code and methodology for the analysis, are available for public use on GitHub.

The topic of water scarcity touches every individual and manages to make the complex and complicated climate crisis tangible. Our research makes it understandable that water can become scarce for every individual – also in Germany. Local journalists published over 40 stories across the country using the data from our analysis, and with their work bringing this important discussion even closer to the public.",German,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/kampf-um-wasser/2022/10/25/klimawandel-grundwasser-in-deutschland-sinkt/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/klimawandel/2022/06/14/klimawandel-konflikt-um-wasser-in-deutschland/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/kampf-um-wasser/2022/11/22/klimawandel-wasser-knapp-industrie-hat-jahrzehntelange-entnahmerechte/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/klimawandel/2022/11/02/grundwasser-atlas-lokal-welche-regionen-besonders-betroffen-sind/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/klimawandel/2022/06/24/wasser-verbrauch-unternehmen-private-haushalte/,https://correctiv.org/lokal/workshops/,https://correctiv.org/themen/klima/,https://github.com/correctiv/grundwasser-data,,
